- Make sure that you read the README file first.

DISCLAIMER: The records functionality on windows has only been tested on
            Windows 2000 running the Windows native port of Xemacs version
            21.1.13. Your milage may vary.

For running records on Windows, do the following:

1. Download cygwin from http://www.cygwin.com

2. Make sure you have the HOME environment variable set. This variable should
   not have trailing slashes or backslashes. In Windows 2000, environment
   variables are set by right clicking "Properties" on the "My Computer" icon,
   then clicking "Advanced -> Environment Variables".

3. Run the cygwin shell program, a.k.a, bash.

4. Make a symbolic link from your xemacs.exe executable to /usr/bin/xemacs. 
   The xemacs.exe executable will probably be located in an area such as 
   //C/Program Files/Xemacs/XEmacs-21.1.13/i386/-pc-win32/xemacs.exe

   Thus ln -s "//C/Program Files/Xemacs/XEmacs-21.1.13/i386/-pc-win32/xemacs.exe" /usr/bin/xemacs

Thats it. Now go to the INSTALL file or the info file.

NOTES and (potential) BUGS: 

1. The native port of xemacs and cygwin treat file paths quite differently. In
   particular, xemacs doesn't understand file paths generated by cygwin. The
   recordsadmin program goes to some trouble to fix this problem (Look at
   cygwin_translate_path). However, this functionality has not be well tested
   and it is very possible that records won't work on other Windows ports of
   emacs.

2. Records uses cygwin for programs such as make and perl. Cygwin programs are
   not used after records is installed.

3. If you have problems during (or after) installation, fix the paths in
   ~/.emacs-records by hand (however much the file may claim that you
   shouldn't do it!). Then run make again.
