Version 1.4.9
        * Installation now works for native Windows NT port of xemacs. Look at
          the INSTALL-NT file for more details.
        * Added a mode specific menu that pops up when the right button is
          pressed. This button pops up a link specific menu when the button is
          clicked on a records link.
        * When records are inserted, template code can be added to
          records (by subject). For instance, this allows adding the current
          time when a record is inserted. Uses the tempo lisp package.
        * Added support for editing a record in outline minor mode.
        * Added support for editing a record in latex mode (interaction with
          outline minor mode not tested).
        * Added support for outputing the concatenation of records in latex
          mode (see records-concatenate-records-latex and
          records-concatenate-record-files-latex).
        * Records can now be concatenated and presented in most-recent first or
          the reverse order.
        * Made almost all records variables customizable.
        * records-goto-link now supports html links of the form <a href=...>
        * Pressing the middle button when on a records link chases the link,
          while pressing it at any other place on a record invokes the default
          binding of the middle button.
        * Added a newline to the end of the index and dindex files when they
          are created the first time.
        * Changed the records-mode-font-lock-keywords variable so that all
          references (links enclosed in <..>) are highlighted and not just
          the link in the header of the records subject. As always, use the
          middle button to go to the link.
        * Fixed a bug where the first entry in the dindex file was
          out-of-order.
        * Fixed a date normalization bug in recordsadmin (this bug was kicking
          in when the year is stored in 2 digits and the year is greater than
          or equal to 2001!) 
        * Fixed a bug in records encryption and decryption where the correct
          encryption scheme (such as pgp, gpg, etc.) was not being loaded.
        * Removed the use of ripem user id for encryption and decryption of
          records. Now the encryption scheme's user id is used by default.
        * Added records-autoloads file, which has the records autoloaded
          functions.

Version 1.4.8
        * Fix fontification bugs in gnu emacs introduced in 1.4.7.

Version 1.4.7
        * Clicking with the middle button on a records link invokes
          records-goto-link

        * Enabled font-lock support instead of using home-grown fontification,
          code by Robert Mihram. records-bold-face not used anymore. See
          records-use-font-lock and records-mode-font-lock-keywords. 
        * Renamed records-insert-file-link to records-insert-link. This 
          function will now also insert urls and news message ids.
        * records-goto-link will follow message ids to jump to news messages 
          on deja.com.
        * Added support for PGP version 5.0 for encrypting and decrypting
          records. Users must set mc-default-scheme. Look at the mailcrypt
          package.

Version 1.4.6
        * Fixed a Y2K bug when years were specified in 2 digits!
        * Added functionality so that records of the same subject can be 
          searched across records files. Thanks to Kaarthik Sivakumar.
        * Fixed fontification bug for emacs so that the first character after
          the record subject is not read-only. This fixes an
          encryption/decryption bug in emacs also.

Version 1.4.5
        * configure now takes an argument so that xemacs can be specified
          for byte compiling the elisp files.
        * recordsadmin now updates the load path in ~/.emacs-records even 
          when the user specifies that the init file variables should not be
          updated. This is needed otherwise the load path becomes inconsistent 
          with the new installation. The init file variables are of course not
          updated.

Version 1.4.4
        * Fixed small bugs in TODO processing
        * Files are saved after TODO processing, records insertion and 
          deletion if they were not modified previously.
        * Empty record files are deleted after TODO processing and 
          deletion of records.
        * Added records-move-record that will allow moving a record to 
          another date. 
        * Added records-insert-file-link for inserting the current file
          as a link into today's record file.

Version 1.4
        * New function records-create-todo for creating new todos.
        * The default values of records-todo-begin-move-regexp, 
        * records-todo-begin-copy-regexp and records-todo-end-regexp 
        * has been changed and made more sane.
        * The info file has minor updates.
        * Added the NEWS file!

Version 1.3
        * Records now has an info file available.
        * Bug fixes in encryption and decryption of records.
