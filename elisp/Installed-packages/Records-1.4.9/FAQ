1. Can I change the location of .emacs-records?
2. Can I have spaces in the subject title?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The package installs .emacs-records in my home directory. I somehow dont 
like the idea of cluttering my home directory. I was wondering if it was 
possible to move this file to my records directory. Can I do it after I 
install it and change the corresponding lines in recordsadmin or do I have to 
install it again? If I have to install it again, which files do I have to 
change for this to take effect?

This is a bootstraping problem. Since recordsadmin creates this file the first
time and then uses this file everytime you invoke it, I assumed a fixed place
for it. Otherwise I would have to store the location of this file in some
known place. I could use configure to ask the user to specify an area, but
then what is the appropriate default? Making the default be inside the records
directory requires some work because the records directory variable itself is
customizable.

The way you can move .emacs-records to ~/records is the following:
  a) Set the following variable in recordsadmin
  # global - should be set by makefile
  $records_init_file="$ENV{HOME}/records/.emacs-records";

  b) In .emacs
  (load "~/records/.emacs-records")
  (setq records-init-file (concat (getenv "HOME") "/records/.emacs-records"))

2. When I insert a new record using C-c C-i or the menu, and type in the
subject (or title) of the record, emacs does completion. And completion does 
not allow for space in the record title. So I am forced to have either single 
word titles or words-separated-by-hyphens or something similar titles. Is this 
a feature or a bug? I dont mind having to type to hyphens or underscores, but 
it would help to have spaces.

You can have space in titles. The way you do it is to type C-q before typing
in the space. That puts the literal space character in emacs. So for example
you would type

C-cC-iSpaceC-qTest

and that would generate

* Space Test
