    should.

Sat Oct 21 02:02:27 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@mot.com>

* br-c-tags (tags_file): Fixed bug that erased first comma in a structure
    or enum entries, preventing the browser from displaying the source for
    such entries.

* br-init.el (br-after-term-init): Changed call of 'hmouse-setup' to
    'hmouse-shift-buttons' which fixes bug of mouse keys not being
    initialized properly and hmouse-setup function being undefined when a
    full Hyperbole distribution is not available.

Wed Oct  4 13:41:52 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@mot.com>

* br-lib.el (br-real-add-class): 
            (br-real-build-parents-alist): 
            (br-show-parents): Don't try to scan file if it is unreadable.
            (br-search-directory): Fixed problem that caused scanning to
    stop if encountered an unreadable file or invalid link.  Now just
    displays a message.

Wed Sep 20 12:30:37 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@mot.com>

* br.el (br-report-bug): Added to send a message to oo-browser discussion
    list and bound to {C-c C-b}.

            (br-env-cond-build): Prompt for background building.
            (br-env-build): Modified to prompt for whether or not to build
    in background when background flag is not t or nil.

* smt-browse.el (smt-browse): 
* info-brows.el (info-browse): 
* objc-brows.el (objc-browse): 
* eif-browse.el (eif-browse): 
* clos-brows.el (clos-browse):
* c++-browse.el (c++-browse):
* java-brows.el (java-browse): Rewrote to quit if user chooses not to

    alert him with a message that the Environment must be built before
    browsing.

* br-env.el (br-env-create): Modified to allow background builds when
    re-specify current Environment and to only build the Environment if
    called interactively.
            (br-env-try-load): Renamed from br-env-force-load and rewrote
    to just try to load Environment once, instead of looping, so user can
    easily quit.
            (br-env-init): Modified to return Env file name loaded or nil
    if load fails.

* br-c++.el (c++-src-file-regexp): Ellemtel C++ recommendations specify
    that inline definition files should use the suffix ".icc" and other
    people use ".I" for such files, so those suffixes are included here.

* br-java.el (java-get-package-name): Simplified and fixed bug that
    triggered error if search failed.

    encourage people to recognize the real name of the package.  Also
    reversed meaning of the prefix argument so that by default, it always
    prompts for the Environment to browse, thereby removing a common
    problem new users have of not being able to specify the Environment
    location.  Immediately hitting {RET} when prompted browses the most
    recently browsed Environment, if any.

Wed Sep 13 11:21:17 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@mot.com>

* man/oo-browser.texi (Customization): Documented br-skip-dir-regexps and
    br-file-dir-regexp variables.

	    (br-env-lang-var): 
            (br-env-version): Added this variable to record the OO-Browser

    set.

* br-eif-ft.el (eif-feature-signature-to-regexp): Fixed bug which

        (br-c-tags-flag): Added to control whether C tags are built for
    C-based language Environments.

                (c++-scan-features-in-class): Modified to leave { or ;
     terminator in feature tags, so can distinguish declarations from
     definitions.

    speed up feature entry listings.
  br-c++-ft.el (c++-scan-features-in-class): Fixed to list this feature
    'operator int() { return i; }', as 'operator int' instead of just
    'int'.

  br-c++-ft.el  (c++-type-tag-separator): Changed from "|" to "," or "@" to

               (c++-feature-decl-or-def): Fixed bug in regexp that could

    since the wrong group would grab "mai".

Tue Apr 11 12:55:11 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@mot.com>

* br-clos-ft.el (clos-element-tag-list): Fixed to ignore any parameters
    following an &keyword since these cannot be specialized (given a specific
    type).  Also assigned all methods which are not specialized to CLOS
    default class 't'.

* BR-README: Clarified autoload directions.

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-decl-or-def): Allowed for whitespace following
   the :: scoping operator.  Some people actually use it.

               (smart-br-assist): Modified to invoke the OO-Browser, if
   not in it.  This can occur if an Action/Assist key press occurs in a

           (BATCHFLAGS): Removed -no-site-file so addition of the
    OO-Browser directory to load-path may be done in site-start.el.

Wed Apr  5 17:11:31 1995  Bob Weiner  (weiner@mot.com)

* br-c++.el (c++-parent-regexp): Added an extra c++-comment-regexp

	       (c++-func-args-string): Modified to add optional spaces
    between a C++ type and '*' or '&' characters since the spacing
    sometimes varies between declaration and definition, e.g. declaration
    is "func(const List<T>&);" and def is "func(const List<T> &id) {}".

* br-ftr.el (br-edit-feature): Added to jump to feature when tag-entry and
    file of feature def have already been computed.
* br-ftr.el    (br-find-feature):

    parent is an instantiation of a template class.

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-signature-to-regexp): Rewrote to ignore the
    template parameter names when matching to a class template method.

==============================================================================

    template parameters, e.g. class<T1,T2,T3>

* tree-x: New release that redraws whole canvas when a tree is collapsed
    as a stopgap measure to fix improper tree display after collapse (trees
    collide and overwrite one another).

    functions.
                (c++-scan-features): Improved handling of non-class member
    functions and eliminated false matches to class definitions.

* br.el (br-unique): Rewrote to handle all entry types.
        (br-order): Rewrote both of these functions to maintain element
    tags under Emacs 19.

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-clear-signatures):
            (br-feature-get-signature):
	    (br-feature-get-tags):
	    (br-feature-put-signatures): Added Emacs 19 versions that use
    text-properties so that tag associations stay with entry lines after a

==============================================================================

Fri Mar 24 10:42:11 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@mot.com>

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-scan-features): Fixed so skips to end of a feature
    definition before looking for another.  This prevents matches to things
    that look like feature definitions, e.g.  if(flag) {}, inside feature
    bodies.

* br.el (br-this-level-entries): Added.  Returns list of entry names
    from current listing.
        (br-match-entries): Added to filter current entry listing.

* Makefile: Fixed problems in a number of areas with different versions
    of make.

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-signature-to-name): Fixed recently added
    problem of deleting space and [] from names such as "operator []".

    inheritance clauses.

==============================================================================
* V2.8.2 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

* br-c++-ft.el: Added class name at the front of feature tags as in other
    languages to speed tag lookups which can now often use string lookups
    rather than regexp lookups.

* br-lib.el (br-delete-space): Added this function and used in br-c++-ft.el.

* br.el (br-where): Rewrote to handle entities in addition to classes.

* br-clos-ft.el (clos-element-tag-list): Fixed bug that added nil values
    to constant and variable definition tags, preventing the browser from
    finding them when trying to view their definitions.

                (clos-feature-name-to-regexp): Rewrote to work properly.

Sun Mar 19 23:46:34 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@mot.com>

* br-clos.el (clos-type-identifier-chars): Added back [] characters so
    that default class features will be shown properly in listing buffers.

==============================================================================

Fri Mar 10 14:40:55 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@footloose>

	* OO-Browser V2.8 is released.

* man/oobr.texi: Rearranged and renamed many sections for clarity.
                (Browsing Categories): 
                (Browsing Protocols): Added these two sections.

* br-compl.el (br-complete-type): Generalized for languages other than C++.

* br.el (br-next-class): 
        (br-prev-class): Renamed to br-*-entry.
        (br-next-class-window): 
        (br-prev-class-window): Renamed to br-*-listing-window.

Mon Mar  6 12:04:30 1995  Bob Weiner  (weiner@footloose)

* br-lib.el (br-setup-constants): Removed br-show-features setting from
    here so that it is a global setting that applies to all languages.
    Otherwise, it would typically be set to nil each time you browsed an
    Environment using a different language.  This is not what most users
    would want.

* br-tree.el (br-tree-filter): Rewrote for improved efficiency.  Also
   display an invalid command message and beep if graphical browser sends
   an invalid command.  Also fixed bug in handling long feature signatures
   which come in as multiple output strings.

* Makefile (tags): Added tree-x and tree-nx source tags into TAGS build.

* tree-x: Replaced the old Motif X OO-Browser with the new Xt-based one.

* br-tree.el (br-tree-do-cmd): Fixed bug that could cause
    br-feature-tree-command-p to be invoked in languages for which it is not
    defined.

* br-objc-ft.el (objc-feature-locate-p): Fixed so if try to browse method2
    from class2 which is defined after method1 of class1 in the same file,
    and method1 and method2 have the same name, it works.  Previously, the
    class in which the method was defined was ignored under Objective-C.

* br.el (br-children): 
        (br-parents): 
	(br-ancestors)
	(br-descendants): When applied to a single class, eliminated narrow
   of listing to that class.  Instead insert class in output listing, just
   like when applied to a whole listing.  This also makes producing
   graphical displays of a listing simpler.

Sat Mar  4 14:38:45 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@avatar>

* br-objc-ft.el (objc-list-categories): 
  	        (objc-list-protocols): Added to support category and
  protocol browsing.
* br-lib.el (br-setup-functions): Added per-language "list-features" and
    "list-protocols" functions.

Fri Mar  3 14:00:24 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@avatar>

* br.el (br-mode-map): Added {C} = br-categories and {P} = br-protocols.
        (br-categories): Added to show class categories.
        (br-protocols): Added to show protocols to which a class conforms.

* br-lib.el (br-real-add-class): Trigger error if class-name is nil or if
    replace is attempted on a non-existent class.

* br.el (br-features): Modified so if no feature definitions for the class
   in the Environment, then browse feature declarations by displaying the
   class definition.

* br-compl.el (br-class-completions): 
  br.el (br-show-top-classes):
        (br-match): Added (br-class-list-filter classes) so each language
    can filter the set of classes listed when showing top classes or
    matching to class names.  Set this language-specific function to
    'identity for all languages except Objective-C where protocols and
    class categories are filtered out.

Fri Mar  3 02:03:42 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@footloose>

* br-lib.el (br-real-build-al)
    (br-search-directory): Modified scanning message to lead with
    last path component in case long paths in the minibuffer would
    otherwise obscure it.

* br-objc-ft.el
  br-objc.el
  objc-brows.el: Numerous changes to support category and protocol browsing.

Thu Mar  2 00:16:49 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@footloose>

  br-objc-ft.el (objc-list-features): Fixed bug where 2nd and 3rd search
    args were reversed.

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-type-regexp): Added this constant to match to
    leading character of an OO-Browser feature listing.
* br-ftr.el (br-feature-entry): 
  br-compl.el (br-find-class-name):
  br-objc-ft.el (objc-feature-signature-to-regexp):
    Used this new constant.

* br.el (br-sort-options): Added to control the way listing buffers are sorted.

Wed Mar  1 10:40:54 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@footloose>

* br-compl.el (br-all-classes): Rewrote to omit sort in most cases, since
    many functions that call this will do their own sorting.

* br-lib.el (br-class-path): Made this return nil if class-path is equal
    to br-null-path.

* br.el: Redefined and rebound these commands to be more representative of
  what they now do, considering that class features may now be other
  things than just routines and that {f} and {F} will now list feature
  names and feature tags respectively.
	OLD-NAME      NEW-NAME                   OLD-KEY  NEW-KEY
	=========================================================
	br-find       Use br-edit-entry instead.         {C-u e}
	br-routines   br-features                   r       f

Tue Feb 28 10:11:04 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@footloose>

* hasht.el (hash-length):
           (hash-size): Changed these 2 functions to return size of the
    hash-table structure rather than number of elements.
           (hash-count): Added this to return number of elements in hash-table.

* br-clos-ft.el (clos-element-tag-list): Renamed from 'clos-element-tag' and
    changed to return a list of tags since one method definition may
    generate features in many classes.

* hasht.el (hash-copy):      Added to copy first level of a hash table.
           (hash-deep-copy): Added to copy all levels of a hash table.
    Redesigned internal data structure so can tell hash tables from
    vectors, so that copy routines know how to copy symbol values from the
    hash table obarray.

Sun Feb 26 17:03:37 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@footloose>

* man/oobr.texi (Browsing Implementors):

    class name from being included when with-class option is given.

* br-init.el (br-skip-dir-regexps): Added skip of SCCS subdirectories and
    made this a user variable.

* Makefile: Changed so that elc target just rebuilds out of date elc
  files, not all elc files.  all-elc now does that.

Fri Feb 24 17:19:37 1995  Bob Weiner  (weiner@footloose)

* br-compl.el (br-buffer-menu): Rewrote to handle case where filename is
    stripped from path listed under File section in Buffer-menu.  Use
    buffer names instead.  Slower, but correct in more cases.

Thu Feb 23 10:51:53 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@footloose>

* man/oobr.texi (Glossary): Added a number of OO terms.

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-get-signature): Changed to return nil when no
    feature signature is found, instead of "".

* br.el (br-this-level-features): Modified to list features only, not classes.

* br.el (br-implementors): 
  br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-implementors): 
  br-clos-ft.el (clos-feature-implementors): 
  br-objc-ft.el (objc-feature-implementors): Changed to support browsing
    implementor feature from each class.

* br-objc-ft.el (objc-feature-implementors): 
  	        (objc-feature-matches): Fixed these functions so that
    br-implementors works properly for Objective-C.

Wed Feb 22 14:31:55 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@footloose>

* br-lib.el (br-build-lib-htable): Added (run-hooks 'br-after-build-lib-hook).
            (br-build-sys-htable): Added (run-hooks 'br-after-build-sys-hook).
    This allows language-specific actions which add to library and system
    classes after the source code has been scanned, e.g. to add categories
    as classes.
  br-clos-ft.el:  Used above hook to add element category classes to system
    classes, since the elements in these classes change as the system
    evolves.

Tue Feb 21 14:38:47 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@footloose>

* br-tree.el
  man/oobr.texi
  br-help
  br.el (br-mode-map): Renamed 'br-tree-routines-toggle' to
    'br-tree-features-toggle' and moved key binding from {M-r} to {M-f}.
    Renamed 'br-show-routines' to 'br-show-features'.

* *.el: Changed all -ftr- to -feature-.
* br*[fr]t.el: Clarified many symbol names within these files.

* br-clos-ft.el
  br-clos-rt.el: Added these 2 files to support feature browsing in CLOS
    and BWlib, my own object system which looks like CLOS.

Fri Feb 17 00:12:37 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@footloose>

* br-objc-rt.el (objc-scan-routines-in-class): 
* br-c++-rt.el  (c++-scan-routines-in-class): Fixed bug that failed to save
    normalized form of routine for return.

Sun Feb 12 16:09:29 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@footloose>

* br-clos.el (clos-src-file-regexp): Updated to scan .el files, so
    will-read CLOS-like definitions in Emacs Lisp code.  Normal CLOS code
    directories will not contain any such code, so will not be affected.

Thu Feb  9 13:19:38 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@footloose>

* hasht.el (hash-make): Modified to accept an integer as the first
    argument, meaning create an empty hash table with that minimum size.

    that appears when try to set an as yet undefined symbol.

Tue Jan  3 16:49:44 1995  Bob Weiner  (weiner@meltdown)

    definition in a source file.

Thu Dec 15 12:37:31 1994  Bob Weiner  (bweiner@sun29)

* tree-x/intf.c: Rewrote to handle X displays of varying sizes.

* br-objc-ft.el (objc-feature-def-pat): 
  br-c++-ft.el  (c++-feature-def-pat): Rewrote to simplify and to eliminate
    call to read-from-string, which may be unreliable in this usage.

* tree-x/input.c (GetNextToken): Changed 'char c' to 'int c', otherwise,
    cannot detect EOF and all possible chars.

Fri Dec  9 18:05:50 1994  Bob Weiner  (bweiner@sun29)

    suffix to using "-FTR" suffix.

Wed Sep 21 14:52:39 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun166)

* br-ftr.el (br-ftr-found-p): Fixed bug that could cause return value of
    nil when feature was found and source file of feature definition was
    read from disk the first time.

Wed Sep 21 11:45:26 1994  Bob Weiner  (bweiner@sun1)

* br.el (br-mode): Added (run-hooks 'br-mode-hook).

Wed Mar 30 21:07:37 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* br.el (br-feature): Fixed to trigger an error if can't find match within
    source code for a feature declaration tag.

* br.el (br-to-view-window): Fixed to set *br-prev-class-window*.
        (br-to-from-viewer): Fixed to move to some other window even if 
    *br-prev-class-window* is not set.

* br-ftr.el (br-ftr-current): Fixed bug that removed routine signature
    information which followed the parameter list, e.g. function() const.

* br-lib.el (br-real-delete-class): Fixed bug in call to hash-replace.
            (br-major-mode): Added and replaced calls to br-lang-mode with
    this, which only sets the mode if it is not set already.

* c++-browse.el (c++-browse-setup): Added conditional for cc-mode, new
    name for C++ mode under Emacs.

Thu Aug 19 21:05:00 1993  Bob Weiner  (weiner@info)

* br-lib.el:   Fixed 'br-real-build-alists-br' to not erase routine tags file
    when called.  This would lead to an empty routine file if sys paths had
    methods but lib paths was built after and it did not have methods.
  br-env.el:   Updated 'br-env-build' to delete br-ftr-tags-file and its
    buffer before doing build since is no longer done in 'br-real-build-alist-br'.

Sat Apr 24 15:29:46 1993  Bob Weiner  (weiner at localhost)

*  br-xbr.el:  Renamed to br-tree.el.
   xbr:        Renamed to tree-x
   tree-nx:    Added for NEXTSTEP graphical browsing.

Fri Apr 23 12:34:32 1993  Bob Weiner  (weiner@info)

*  br-init.el, br-lib.el: Added 'br-skip-dir-regexps' to make list of
   directories skipped by browser file scans programmable.

Sat May  4 07:02:58 1991  Bob Weiner  (rsw at barney)

*  br-lib.el, br-eif.el: Added
     (let ((inhibit-local-variables nil))
   to prevent setting from prompting user when files are read in.

Mon Dec 24 07:21:37 1990  Bob Weiner  (rsw at tahiti)

* br.el:  Modified (br-help) to remove local keymap so normal movement
	   commands work within help buffers.

==============================================================================
V2.6 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

Thu Dec 20 19:04:32 1990  Bob Weiner  (rsw at slate)

** br.el, br-lib.el, br-init.el:  Added full support for use of non-Emacs
      browser viewers and editors.  All such tools are handled as
      sub-processes, so they can be kill off through the Emacs interface if
      desired.

** br.el: Added (br-toggle-keep-viewed) bound to {C-c v} to keep/not keep
     all viewed buffers in memory.  Default is to keep only last one.

** br.el: Modified (br-match) so it allows repeated filtering of class lists to
   hone in on desired classes.

** br-xtree.el:  Renamed to br-xbr.el.

Wed Dec 19 15:24:55 1990  Bob Weiner  (rsw at delay)

** br-xtree.el:  Added support for multiple simultaneous xtree browsing
     sessions and optimized context time maximally when outside of
     OO-Browser UI and pretty well when in UI (just have to sort
     classes in order to display).

Mon Dec 17 01:16:49 1990  Bob Weiner  (rsw at tahiti)

** br.el:  Added {H} (br-help-ms) command to display mouse help.
   br-lib.el: Added 'br-keep-viewed-classes' flag which if nil
     deletes each class file as a new one is viewed.  By default, is nil.
     t value leaves viewed classes around for further manipulation.

Wed Oct 17 22:12:00 1990  Bob Weiner  (rsw at slate)

** br.el:  Improved ordering of large class lists by using UNIX "sort".

Mon Oct 15 01:26:56 1990  Bob Weiner  (rsw at tahiti)

** eif-calls.el:  br-info-class did not work since 'eif-try-for-routine-call'
     used the wrong parameters for string matching.  Fixed.

Sat Oct  6 15:12:36 1990  Bob Weiner  (rsw at betty)

** br-eif-ft.el:  Created this file.  Allows selection of a feature name in a
     class export clause and moves point to feature definition if within the
     same source file.  Also goes to class def when class name is selected.

Mon Oct  1 18:13:46 1990  Bob Weiner  (rsw at tahiti)

** hash.el: Removed sorting of value elements in 'hash-make' function.
   br-eif.el: Sorted class list elements in 'eif-real-build-paths-alist'.
   br-lib.el: Removed list reversal from 'br-real-build-parents-alist'
     and 'br-real-build-alists-br'.
     Sorted each set of classes in path list construction in
     'br-real-build-al'.
   These changes fixed display of parents so that they are listed in the same
     order as they are in the source file.

** br-env.el: Eliminated use of 'br-use-children-htable'; now assume always
     true. This option added virtually no value.

Wed Sep 26 14:07:34 1990  Bob Weiner  (rsw at tahiti)

** br.el: Fixed 'br-narrow-to-class' to work with info-browse class names.
          Added error handling into 'br-view' for when class which is
	  referenced but not defined in environment is selected.

** br-env.el:  Modified 'br-env-set-htables' function to add class
     names that are referenced but not defined into the library part of the
     environment.

Tue Sep 25 13:22:57 1990  Bob Weiner  (rsw at tahiti)

** br-c++-ft.el:  Added 'c++-include-dirs' variable used to set extra include
     directories to search.

** br-c++-ft.el:  Created this file.  Allows selection of a class declaration
     within a class definition and moves point to member definition if within a
     file in the same directory.  Handles overloading but not inherited members
     yet.  Also goes to class def when class name is selected.

** br-info.el:
   info-brows.el:  Added these two files, allows hierarchical browsing,
     searching of sets of Info manuals.

**  br-lib.el:
    br.el:      Modified 'br-view' and 'br-find-class' slightly to accomodate
      special needs of the Info browser.

** br-clos.el:
   clos-brows.el:
   br-smt.el
   smt-browse.el:  Tested and added CLOS and Smalltalk browser support.

Fri Sep 21 00:26:17 1990  Bob Weiner  (rsw at tahiti)

** br.el:  Stored current window line in '*br-level-hist*' in order to make
    'br-exit-level' position all lines in buffer exited to, exactly as they
    were before.

** br.el:  Switched default at browser startup 'br-browse' and when refresh
     screen 'br-refresh' or rebuild environments 'br-sys-rebuild' and
    'br-lib-rebuild' to display all classes rather than just the top-level
    classes as they did before.  This prevents novice confusion over where his
    classes are and allows easier access to all users.

Tue Sep 18 16:37:59 1990  Bob Weiner  (rsw at delay)

** br-c++.el:  Fixed def of 'c++-identifier' to allow '~' as first identifier
     character to account for destructor functions.

** br.el:  Added 'br-interrupt' function.  Is used by 'br-quit' and
     'br-view-full-screen' to bury all browser buffers. 

Fri Sep 14 03:04:31 1990  Bob Weiner  (rsw at tahiti)

** br-c++.el:  Kept from matching translated C source files that end in ..[cC].

** br-init.el:  Made browser Lisp files autoload when needed, so eliminated
     conditional flags which enabled each language, e.g. 'br-use-eif'.
     Put browser invocation key bindings at top of file so user can easily
     change them.

Mon Sep  3 16:32:16 1990  Bob Weiner  (rsw at tahiti)

** br-mouse.el:  Modified 'smart-br' to display browser help when a blank class
     listing buffer is clicked in.
     Added 'smart-br-cmd-select' function.  Make note in user manual that
     messages will disappear from minibuffer once release the mouse button
     under some window systems, to see message, simply hold the button down
     until you have read the message.

** br-init.el: Changed 'br-mouse-setup' to use 'smart-key-mouse' rather than
     'smart-key' under SunView and Apollo DM.

** br.el: Changed 'br-help' function so that it uses 'br-mode' as the major
     mode for the browser help buffer.  This is necessary to support the direct
     selection of commands from the help buffer.

Sat Sep  1 19:49:25 1990  Bob Weiner  (rsw at tahiti)

** br.el: Made 'br-mode' function interactive.

Thu Aug 30 23:41:02 1990  Bob Weiner  (rsw at tahiti)

** br-mouse.el: Fixed so would work properly with X windows.  Changed
     'smart-key' and 'smart-key-meta' so they take a single optional arg
     list rather than individual args that end up grouped into a list.
     This works better for X and is unused by most other window systems.

** br-init.el: Made setup of mouse control of browser automatic for X,
     SunView and Apollo DM.



* Changes for version 1.2.4

Wed Aug 29 18:03:12 1990  Bob Weiner (rsw at tahiti))

** Fixed problem with 'br-add-class-file' in "br.el" that set
     children-htable values improperly.


Thu Aug 16 03:31:54 1990  Bob Weiner  (rsw at tahiti)

** Modified 'br-find-class' in "br-lib.el" in the case when
    'br-narrow-view-to-class' is set to nil.  Previously, it just moved
    point to the beginning of the file in which the desired class was found.
    Now places point at the start of the class.

** Changed default value of '<lang>-narrow-view-to-class' to nil for all
     languages.


* Changes for version 1.2.3

Mon Aug  6 00:58:29 1990  Bob Weiner  (rsw at tahiti)

** Changed all filenames to be 14 or fewer chars.


* Changes for version 1.2.2, from 1.2.1

Wed Jul 25 1990  Bob Weiner    (rsw at tahiti)

** Fixed 'br-where' bound to {w} in "br.el" so when called with a prefix
     argument, displays class path properly.

** Added (require 'compile) to "eif-ise-er.el" so that key definition in
     compile would not override eif-ise-er definition of {C-x `} when library
     was autoloaded.  Without this change, error parsing failed the first time
     it was invoked in each Emacs session.

** Added 'eiffel-find-feature' and 'eif-find-feature' to "br-eif.el".  Not yet
     bound to keys, more work must be done in order to do this.

** Changed get parents code in Eiffel to support comments between class
     names in 'inherit' clause (also changed 'eif-parent-regexp' for same
     reason).
