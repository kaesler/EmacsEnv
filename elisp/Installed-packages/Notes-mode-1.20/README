WHAT IS NOTES-MODE?
-------------------

(From the info documentation)

Notes-mode is an indexing system for on-line note-taking.
Notes-mode is composed of two parts, the visible part, a major-mode for
emacs to aid note-taking; and the invisible part, scripts which
periodically index your notes for you.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Notes-mode requires emacs or xemacs version 19 or 20 (or possibly
later) and Perl-5.  For information:

	emacs   http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html
	xemacs  http://www.xemacs.org
	perl    http://www.perl.com


INSTALLATION
------------

First, get notes mode from <http://www.isi.edu/~johnh/SOFTWARE/NOTES_MODE/>.

To install the basic package:
	1. ./configure
	2. make install

(To control what's installed where, use --prefix=/where, or
--with-lisp-dir=/where, --datadir=/where (for scripts),
and --infodir=/where.)

For each user:
	1. Run notesinit
		(from where it's installed, /usr/local/bin/notesinit
		by default)

If you have problems with paths being incorrect, please be aware that
you CANNOT run notes directly out of where you untar it.  The
installation process customizes the programs for where things are on
your system.  Make sure you move out of the directory where you
untarred it before running it.

After you've installed notes mode you're encouraged to subscribe
to the mailing lists:
Send the message "subscribe" to
	notes-mode-announce-request@heidemann.la.ca.us and 
	notes-mode-talk-request@heidemann.la.ca.us.
(Or use majordomo@heidemann.la.ca.us.)
