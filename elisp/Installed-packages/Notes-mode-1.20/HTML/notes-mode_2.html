<P>
All you need to use notes-mode
 in a chapter.
(Except for installation, See section <A HREF="notes-mode_5.html#SEC26">Installation</A>.)




<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="notes-mode_toc.html#TOC10">Getting started</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>


<P>
To get started with notes-mode,
 read the introduction this chapter,
 then run the program <TT>`notesinit'</TT>
 to set up everything notes-mode needs.
This program will modify your environment (as described in this section),
 or it will give you the exact commands you should run yourself.


<P>
After you've run <TT>`notesinit'</TT>,
 start up emacs and note-away.
I usually begin a
 day of note-taking by running the command
 <KBD>M-x</KBD> <CODE>notes-index-todays-link</CODE>
 to jump directly to today's note.
You may even wish to bind this to something,
 perhaps with
 <CODE>(define-key global-map "\C-cn" 'notes-index-todays-link)</CODE>
 in your <TT>`.emacs'</TT>. 


<P>
If you want to browse your existing notes,
 you might instead want to edit the
 <TT>`~/NOTES/index'</TT>.
(What is a notes file and the index? Hurry up and finish
 reading this chapter.) 




<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="notes-mode_toc.html#TOC11">A notes file</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>


<P>
The notes file is the focus of most of the activity in notes-mode,
 it's where you take your notes.
Notes files are mostly free-form text
 broken up into <EM>entries</EM>.
Here's an example:


<P>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>



<PRE>
8-Jun-95 Thursday
-----------------

* Today
-------
prev: &#60;none&#62;
next: &#60;file:///~/NOTES/199506/950609#* Today&#62;

next week - release notes-mode

* Environment/notes
-------------------

I explained notes mode to Ashvin and Geoff.
...
</PRE>

<P>
Each entry has a subject-block, (maybe) some links, and then (maybe) some text.


<P>
The subject-block must begin with an asterisk-space (<KBD>* </KBD>)
 at the beginning of a line, followed by the subject itself.
Subjects must be underlined with a row of dashes
 (if they're not exact, that's OK;
 notes-mode will fix them periodically).
For convenience,
 notes-mode will automatically add the underlines when you
 hit <KBD><KBD>RTN</KBD></KBD> (<CODE>notes-electric-return</CODE>),
 and <KBD><KBD>TAB</KBD></KBD> on a partially completed subject will
 invoke completion based on indexed subjects (<CODE>notes-complete-subject</CODE>).
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>


<P>
Following the subject may be links.
(In the example, the "Today" entry has links,
 the "Environment/notes" entry doesn't.)
These links will be automatically updated by notes-mode
 when your notes are re-indexed;
 just leave a blank line when writing the note.
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>


<P>
Links are made with pseudo-URLs,
 sort of like those in the World Wide Web. 
Any of these URLs can be followed in notes-mode files
 by clicking <KBD>S-mouse-2</KBD> on the pseudo-URL
 (<CODE>notes-w3-follow-link-mouse</CODE>).
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>


<P>
Finally comes the text.
Go wild, but just don't include text that looks like a subject.
You can embed pseudo-URLs to link notes together manually.


<P>
The more anal of you may have noticed
 that the lines before the first subject
 are not part of any entry.
These lines are
 <EM>front matter</EM>.
They're not usually used for much,
 but they can be a good place to label the file.
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>


<P>
There are a number of useful conventions
 that can be adopted to organize your notes.
The most common is the "Today" entry.
If you keep an entry with the same subject
 at the beginning of each file,
 you link all of your notes together.
Notes-mode will help you out with some of these convetions
 by automatically creating or copying some fields for you;
 see see section <A HREF="notes-mode_3.html#SEC19">Useful conventions</A> for details.


<P>
Finally, notes-mode can also work with outline-minor-mode
 (thanks to Tim Carroll for pointing this out).
Outline-mode supports hiding and revealing text and other helpful
 features beyond the scope of this document.
See section `Outline Mode' in <CITE>The Emacs Editor</CITE>, for details.




<H2><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="notes-mode_toc.html#TOC12">The notes index</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>


<P>
The notes index lists all subjects you've kept notes about,
 and each date of each note.
Impress your friends,
 show your advisor why you're worth the <EM>big</EM> peanuts,
 you'll soon have the biggest index of all.


<P>
The index has one line per subject, listing the subject
 and each day a note was made about that subject.
For example:



<PRE>
Bicycle: 950314, 950316
Bicycle/maintenance/books: 951028
Bridge/hands: 951113, 951114, 951116, 951117
Bridge/UCLA: 960222, 960409
</PRE>

<P>
Clicking on any of the dates with <KBD>mouse-2</KBD>
 will take you to that note
 (<CODE>notes-index-mouse-follow-link</CODE>).
(You can also move the point over the date and hit <KBD><KBD>RTN</KBD></KBD>
 if you're musaphobic [<CODE>notes-index-follow-link</CODE>].)
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>


<P>
The notes index is automatically updated by the program <TT>`mkall'</TT>.
Typically <TT>`mkall'</TT> is run nightly by <TT>`cron'</TT>.
On most modern versions of Unix, you can add this command to cron by
 running <TT>`crontab -e'</TT> and adding the line:



<PRE>
0 4 * * * /usr/local/lib/notes-mode/mkall
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>


<P>
(Assuming that your notes programs are installed
 in /usr/local/lib/notes-mode, the default location.)




<H2><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="notes-mode_toc.html#TOC13">The notes directories</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>


<P>
The final thing needed to tie basic notes-mode together his how
the pieces fit together.
Since my graduate work is in file systems,
you can bet that directories are involved.


<P>
Notes-mode keeps its files in a two-level hierarchy:



<PRE>
~/NOTES
~/NOTES/index
~/NOTES/rawindex
~/NOTES/199603
~/NOTES/199603/960329
~/NOTES/199603/960330
~/NOTES/199604
~/NOTES/199604/960401
</PRE>

<P>
The top level, <TT>`~/NOTES'</TT>, is the notes directory.
It keeps all notes in one place.
(The name of this directory is configurable, See section <A HREF="notes-mode_3.html#SEC21">Notes-mode configuration</A>.)


<P>
Inside the notes directory are two files and a number of directories.
The files are <TT>`index'</TT>,
 the index of all entries (see section <A HREF="notes-mode_2.html#SEC12">The notes index</A>),
 and <TT>`rawindex'</TT>,
 used internally.
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>


<P>
The notes directory also contains a number of subdirectories,
 sometimes called <EM>intermediate directories</EM>.
These directories group the actual notes files into manageable chunks,
 keeping any directory from getting too large.
Intermediate directories are named
 by the four-digit year and the two-digit month
 of the entries they contain.
(The format of intermediate directories
 is configurable, See section <A HREF="notes-mode_3.html#SEC21">Notes-mode configuration</A>.)
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>


<P>
Finally,
 each intermediate directory are the notes files themselves,
 named according to the two-digit year, month, and day-of-month.
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>


<P>
For the most part,
 notes-mode will automatically maintain this organization of files,
 once you create the top-level directory.
Notes-mode will also automatically insure
 that all files in the notes directory are unreadable by
 anyone other than their owner.
Notes are personal things.
(This behavior is not currently configurable,
 but it probably should be.)
