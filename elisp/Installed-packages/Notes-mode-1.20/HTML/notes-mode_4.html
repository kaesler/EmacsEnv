<P>
More about notes-mode than you wanted to know,
and some thanks.

<P>
Briefly,
 I started keeping notes on-line shortly after I got a portable computer
 in January, 1994.
After a month-and-a-half of notes, I realized that
 one does not live by grep alone,
 so I started adding indexing facilities.


<P>
In June of 1995
 some other Ficus-project members started
 keeping and indexing on-line notes
 using other home-grown systems.
After some discussion,
 we generalized my notes-mode work and
 they started using it.


<P>
Over the next 18 months notes-mode grew.
Finally, in April, 1996 I wrote documentation,
 guaranteeing that innovation on notes-mode will now cease
 or the documentation will become out of date.




<H2><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="notes-mode_toc.html#TOC24">Credits</A></H2>

<P>
I (John Heidemann, &#60;johnh@isi.edu&#62;)
 started, documented, and currently maintain notes-mode.
I take ultimate responsibility for the code,
 especially for the ugly parts that I won't let others change.


<P>
Ashvin Goel
 &#60;ashvin@ficus.cs.ucla.edu&#62;
 has been a very enthusiastic notes-mode user and contributor.
He is responsible for at least
 the ideas behind <CODE>notes-summarize-subject</CODE>
and the ideas and initial implementations of
 some of the original generalization and modularity improvements,
 <CODE>notes-follow-next-link</CODE> and <CODE>notes-follow-prev-link</CODE>,
 <CODE>notes-goto-index-entry</CODE>,
 programmed subject completion,
 and
 context-sensitive mouse-2 handling.
In addition,
 he is an invaluable second opinion about
 what and how things should be done
 (even if I don't always agree with him).


<P>
Geoff Kuenning
 &#60;geoff@ficus.cs.ucla.edu&#62;
 has been another enthusiastic notes-mode user and victim.
He is responsible for
 finding several bugs,
 motivation for mouse-less operation,
 comments about the documentation,
 the day-of-week convention,
 and an initial implementation and the idea of
 multiple entries with the same subjects in a single notes-file.


<P>
Ramesh Govindan &#60;govindan@isi.edu&#62; did the xemacs port.


<P>
Since it's release on Usenet in April 1996 several
 other folks have contributed.
Thanks to
 David Weisman &#60;weisman@app1.osf.org&#62;,

<P>
Thanks to Larry Ayers &#60;layers@marktwain.net&#62;
 for popularizing notes-mode with reviews in
 the Linux Gazette
 (at &#60;http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue22/notes-mode.html&#62; and
 &#60;http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue35/ayers.html&#62;).




<H2><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="notes-mode_toc.html#TOC25">Changes</A></H2>

<P>
For the bored:


<P>
First semi-public release. 12-Jul-95: version 0.1
 Shared a version with Ashvin and Geoff.


<P>
Changed  6-Dec-95: version 0.3
 Ashvin's changes for note traversal added (C-c C-p and C-c C-n now
move to the prev/next note in note-mode).
 URL parsing changed so that "localhost" is optional.


<P>
Changed 19-Dec-95:  version 0.4
 More robust prev/next code added, both to handle going back and
forward in the middle of chains through the index file, and to handle
back/forward in a single file.
 URL parsing changed so that notes-goto-index-entry correctly handles
lookups on notes names such as "252A".


<P>
Changed 20-Dec-95: version 0.5.
 Fixed a missing variable in notes-url.el.
 Added a work-around to a bug in emacs-19.30's define-derived-mode.


<P>
Changed 24-Dec-95: version 0.6.
 Prev/next code re-re-written to be more robust.


<P>
Changed 26-Dec-96:  version 0.7.
 Bug fix release.


<P>
Changed 23-Jan-96: version 0.8.
 Initialization code added to set up a new note.
New variable:  notes-bin-dir.


<P>
 I'm skipping version 0.9 because I erroneously release version 0.1
as version 0.9 (only on the web, not on Usenet).


<P>
 I'm bumping from version "0" to version "1" since the code is has been
in production use for more than a year by several people.  Minor
numbers are the same.


<P>
Changed 26-Mar-96: version 1.10.
 Setup code completely re-written.
 Several incompatible changes have been made:
 - the lisp and Perl code must be installed via make install,
not by copying.
 - some data is specified in a .notesrc file; copy and modify sample.notesrc.
 - several internal elisp changes.
 - catsubject added (bound to C-cC-s):  collect all notes about the
current subject.
 - new notes-files are initialized with fields based on the prior
day's notes; see mknew for details.
 - daily_work is gone; mkall is rewritten to use .notesrc.


<P>
Changed 29-Apr-96: version 1.11.
 Real documentation.
 Mknew caching added.


<P>
Changed  9-Aug-96: version 1.12.
 Added notesinit to do all setup for new users.


<P>
Changed 24-Aug-96: version 1.13.
 Minor documentation fixes.


<P>
Changed 20-Dec-97: version 1.14.
Autoconf support.


<P>
Fontification of the index buffer is now pre-computed in perl
other than done when the file is needed (in elisp with slow regular
expressions).  2000-line index files are now 1-2 seconds rather than
15-30 on a 100MHz Pentium.  If necessary (the
pre-computed version isn't up-to-date) we fall back on the slower
code.


<P>
Related work improved (suggestion by David Weisman &#60;weisman@app1.osf.org&#62;).


<P>
Documentation improvement (problem found by Martin L. Smith
&#60;martin@ner.com&#62;).


<P>
Installation improved (code by Jason Bastek &#60;jason@aai.com&#62;).


<P>
Bug in notes-index mode with subjects containing colons fixed (johnh).


<P>
Encryption now supports mailcrypt.el.


<P>
Support for emacs 20 (a small font-lock change).


<P>
Changed  5-Jan-98: version 1.15.
Bug in decryption for non-PAM users fixed
 (suggestion by Kevin Davidson &#60;tkld@quadstone.com&#62;).


<P>
Y2K statement added
 (suggestion by Kevin Davidson &#60;tkld@quadstone.com&#62;).


<P>
Pointer to mailcrypt added (as a supported encryption package).
Problem pointed out by K. Ueda &#60;kueda@jupiter.qse.tohoku.ac.jp&#62;.


<P>
Changed  4-Nov-98: version 1.16.
Bug in kill-ring handling of notes-old-underline-line
 fixed by Tim Potter &#60;timp@jna.com.au&#62;.
Bug in whitespace handling after PGP encryption fixed by Tim Potter.
Bugs in handling of entries with hash signs in their name fixed
 (found by Tim Potter).
Fontification of index buffer further improved
 (mapcar is your friend).
Xemacs support added based on code contributed by Ramesh Govindan.


<P>
Changed 28-Feb-99: version 1.17:
Improvement:  notes-electric-return now fixes up the prev/next links
 of new entries (only).  Code contributed by
 Takashi Nishimoto.


<P>
Bug fix:  reversed options -batch and -q in configure.in to placate
 XEmacs 20.0; changed notesinit to not downcase the pathname
 (bugs found by Thierry Bezecourt).


<P>
Clarification: Autofilling of new notes more clear in the manual (hopefully,
 suggested by Solofo Ramangalahy).


<P>
Bug fix:  a y2k bug in was found and fixed in mkindex.  Sigh.


<P>
New:  Two mailing lists for notes-mode have been created:
<TT>`notes-mode-announce@heidemann.la.ca.us'</TT> and 
<TT>`notes-mode-talk@heidemann.la.ca.us'</TT>.
Send the line "subscribe notes-mode-announce"
(or "subscribe notes-mode-talk")
to <TT>`majordomo@heidemann.la.ca.us'</TT>
to join them.


<P>
Changed  6-Oct-99: version 1.18:
Bug fix:  handling of electric-prevnext is better when there are
 existing prev/next links.
 
Clarification: I added some pointers in the code to the installation
 instructions.  (Apparently people can't RTF README.)


<P>
Extension: mailcrypt-3.5.x suported including pgp, pgp5 and gpg.


<P>
Changed (date 23-Dec-00): version 1.19:
Bug fix (cosmetic): suppress comments in encrypted nodes.


<P>
Install fixes from Kannan Varadhan: elisp directories changed on install.


<P>
Added C-j as a synonym for RET in notes-mode to parallel C++ or perl mode.
(Suggested by Fred Jaggi <TT>`jaggi@rsn.hp.com'</TT>.)


<P>
Outline-minor-mode support added and documented.
(Suggested by Tim Carroll <TT>`tim@boomboom.com'</TT>.)


<P>
Bug/typo fixes in gpg support
(Contributed by William A. Perkins <TT>`wa_perkins@pnl.gov'</TT>,
with separate patches from Knut Anders Hatlen <TT>`kahatlen@online.no'</TT>.)


<P>
Installation improvements suggested by Christophe Troestler
<TT>`Ch.Troestler@linkline.be'</TT>:
use install-info to update the info dir,
warn users of --prefix that lisp files go elsewhere.


<P>
Changed (date  1-Feb-01): version 1.20:
Bug fix: missing file notes-first.el added to the distribution.
