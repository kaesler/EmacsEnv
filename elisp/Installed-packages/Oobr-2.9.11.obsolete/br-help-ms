OO-Browser mouse support is available for the X window system, OpenWindows,
NEXTSTEP, SunView and Apollo's Display Manager.  By default, the shift-middle
(or shift-left button on a 2 button mouse) and the shift-right button are
used as the Action and Assist Keys, respectively.  Under InfoDock, the middle
mouse button also serves as the Action Key.
