An 'Environment' describes a set of inter-class relationships used by
the browser.  An 'Environment specification' tells the browser how to build
the associated Environment.  A 'top class' has no parents.  A 'System class'
is part of a system still under development.  A 'Library class' is a stable,
class released for reuse.
