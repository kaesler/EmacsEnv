<h3>Description</h3>

<p><b>camelCase-mode</b> is a Gnu Emacs minor mode which extends the
forward-word, backward-word, delete-word, etc. keystroke-commands so
they also work on words within a <i>camelCase</i> identifier.  As a
minor mode, camelCase-mode can be used within any other editing mode
--- Java-mode, text-mode, etc.  No functionality is lost, since the
forward s-expression, backward s-expression, delete s-expression,
etc. commands are still available to navigate over entire camelCase
names. </P>

<p>Word boundaries within a camelCase name are marked only by letter case.
For example lowerCapitalUPPERCase has four words.  A word may be
lowercase, Capitalized, UPPERCASE, or a sequence of digits.  Besides
non-letter to letter and letter to non-letter word boundaries,
word boundaries in the middle of a sequence of letters are located at
lowercaseCapital, CapitalCapital, lowercaseUPPERCASE,
CapitalUPPERCASE, and UPPERCASECapital boundaries.</p>

<p> Rebound keys:
<code>
<table align="center">
<tr><td>M-f</td><td><i>M-right</i></td><td>C-right</td><td>camelCase-forward-word</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-b</td><td><i>M-left</i></td><td>C-left</td><td>camelCase-backward-word</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-d</td><td><i>M-delete</i></td><td><i>C-delete</i></td><td>camelCase-forward-kill-word</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-DEL</td><td>M-backspace</td><td><i>C-backspace</i></td><td>camelCase-backward-kill-word</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-t</td><td></td><td></td><td>camelCase-transpose-words</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-c</td><td></td><td></td><td>camelCase-capitalize-word</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-u</td><td></td><td></td><td>camelCase-upcase-word</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-l</td><td></td><td></td><td>camelCase-downcase-word</td></tr>
</table>
</code>
 (<i>Italic</i> means only in Gnu Emacs, not in XEMacs; the original
  binding is not to the word command in XEmacs, so it is not overridden.)</p>

<p><code>camelCase-mode</code> prefix arg:
0 turns off, 1 turns on, nil toggles mode.</p>

<h3>Subtleties</h3>

<p>Handles uppercase acronyms within camelCase words.  For example
"URLConnection" is like "URL_Connection", not "URLC_onnection".</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<ul>
<li>Does not affect other Emacs functions which operate on words,
    such as dabbrev-mode
<li>M-t transpose-words does not change case of words.  For example:
  <ul>
  <li>transposing "fooBar" produces "Barfoo", not "barFoo".
  <li>transposing "fooBAR" produces "BARfoo", not "BARFoo".
  <li>transposing "fooBar baz" at space produces "foobaz Bar" not "fooBaz bar"
  </ul>
  When this is an issue, capitalize words before transposing them,
  e.g., M-b M-c M-t for the first two examples, or M-c M-b M-t for
  the last one.
</ul>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>camelCase-mode has been developed and tested on Gnu Emacs 20.7.  It
is also known to work on XEmacs 21.4.  It may well work on other
versions of Emacs.  (There may be variation in how minor modes are
installed.  There may also be variation in syntax for keybindings.) </p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>
To unpack, use your favorite unzipping tool, or use tar directly
(note: .tgz = .tar.gz):<br />
<pre>
  tar -xzf camelCase.tgz
</pre>
To load:
<pre>
  M-x Load-file camelCase/camelCase-mode.elc
</pre>
To toggle on or off from any buffer:
<pre>
  M-x camelCase-mode
</pre></p>

<p>To make it always available, load it from your initialization file.</p>
<p>A suggested Gnu Emacs <code>.emacs</code> (or XEmacs
<code>.xemacs/init.el</code>) file initialization:
<pre>
   (autoload 'camelCase-mode "camelCase/camelCase-mode")
   (add-hook 'java-mode-hook '(lambda () (camelCase-mode 1)))
</pre>
More global hooks are also possible:  
<code>find-file-hooks</code>, <code>post-command-hook</code>
</p>
