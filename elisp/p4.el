;; NOTES:
;; ------
;;
;; It is best if you take this file and byte compile it. To do that, you
;; need to do the following:
;;
;; % emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile /full/path/to/file/p4.el
;;
;; This creates a binary file p4.elc in the path. Add the path to your
;; load-path variable in .emacs like this:
;;
;; (setq load-path (cons "/full/path/to/file" load-path))
;;
;; Then add the library like this:
;;
;; (load-library "p4")
;;

;;; Code:

;; We need to remap C-x C-q to p4-toggle-read-only, so, make sure that we
;; load vc first.. or else, when vc gets autoloaded, it will remap C-x C-q
;; to vc-toggle-read-only.

  "To diff the current file and topmost depot version, type \\[p4-diff].

Run diff (on the client) of a client file against the corresponding
revision in the depot.	The file is only compared if the file is
opened for edit or the revision provided with the file argument is
not the same as the revision had by the client.

If no file argument is given, diff all open files.
This can be used to view pending changes.

The -f flag forces a diff for every file, regardless of whether
they are opened or if the client has the named revision.
This can be used to verify the client contents.

The -s flag outputs reduces the output of diff to the names of files
satisfying the following criteria:

	-sa	Opened files that are different than the revision
		in the depot, or missing.

	-sd	Unopened files that are missing on the client.

	-se	Unopened files that are different than the revision
		in the depot.

to compare the head revision.  Wildcards may be used, but they
must match between file1 and file2 and they must be escaped from
the user's shell by quoting or with backslashes (\).

The -d flag allows you to pass flags to the underlying diff
program.

-dc passes the -c (context diff) flag.

-du passes the -u (unified diff) flag.

-dn passes the the -n (rcs diff) flag.

the current host name.	The specification form is put into a
temporary file and the editor (given by the environment variable
$EDITOR) is invoked.  If a name is given, the specification of
the named client is displayed read-only.

The specification form contains the following fields:

Client:	     The client name (read only.)

Date:	     The date specification was last modified (read only.)

Description: A short description of the client (optional).

Root:	     The root directory of the client file workspace
	     (given in local file system syntax), under which all
	     client files will be placed.  If you change this, you
	     must physically relocate any files as well.

View:	     What files you want to see from the depot and how
	     they map to locations on the client.  The left hand
	     side specifies a depot path, which must begin with
	     //depot/.	The right hand side gives the corresponding
	     client path, given in canonical Perforce file syntax.
	     On expansion to an actual local client file name the
	     initial //client/ is replaced by the Root value, given
	     above.  You may use wildcards:

		 ...		matches any characters including
		 *		matches any character except /
		 %1 to %9	like *, used to associate wild cards

	     Wildcarding must be congruent in both the client and
	     depot paths.  You may have any number of view entries.
	     A new view takes effect on the next 'get'.

all depot files onto the client.  The -t flag uses the view from
the named template client as a default instead.
