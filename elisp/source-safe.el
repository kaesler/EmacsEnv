;;; Commentary:

;;; This file defines a number of functions to manipulate files that are
;;; maintained under the SourceSafe version control system.  SourceSafe is
;;; available from Microsoft, and runs under Windows NT and Win95.  There are
;;; versions of SourceSafe that run on Macs and various flavors of Unix.
;;; More info about SourceSafe can be obtained at the web page
;;;     http://www.microsoft.com/ssafe/

;;;
;;; Authors:
;;;	Stan Lanning <lanning@rational.com>
;;; with contributions from:
;;;     Jake Colman <jcolman@jnc.com>
;;;      - menu additions
;;;	Robert Brodersen <rbrodersen@siebel.com>
;;;	 - support for different SS user name
;;;     Adalbert Bela Homa <belah@nexus.sorostm.ro>
;;;      - baseline files keep the same extension
;;;     Richard Y. Kim <ryk@audiotst.com>
;;;      - suggestion for support of multiple databases
;;;     Matthew Smith <SmithMO@chq.byu.edu>
;;;      - ss-locate()
;;;     Lou Rayman <lrayman@avesta.com>
;;;      - support for passwords
;;;     and many others who pointed out "shortcomings" in earlier versions.

;;; Installation/Usage:
;;;
;;; The only variables that you should futz with are in the
;;; "User definable variables" section early on in the file.
;;; The only variables that you *need* to set are ss-program
;;; and ss-project-dirs.  All the other variables have reasonable
;;; default values.
;;;
;;; For example, you might want to put the following in your
;;; _emacs file:
;;;
;;; (setq ss-program "S:\\WinNT\\SS.exe"
;;;       ss-project-dirs '(("^D:\\\\OCI\\\\" . "$/PurifyW/")))
;;;
;;; (autoload 'ss-diff "source-safe"
;;;  "Compare the current buffer to the version of the file under SourceSafe.
;;;   If NON-INTERACTIVE, put the results in a buffer and switch to that buffer;
;;;   otherwise run ediff to view the differences." t)

  (ss-lock)
      Check out the currently visited file so you can edit it,
      but don't replace your current copy of the file.

  (ss-uncheckout)
      Un-checkout the curently visited file.

  (ss-update)
  (ss-checkin)
      Check in the currently visited file.

  (ss-diff compare-to-baseline-p non-interactive-p)
      Compare the current buffer to the version of the file under SourceSafe.
      If the file is a branched file, and COMPARE-TO-BASELINE-P is TRUE,
      the buffer is compared to the baseline created when the file was branched.
      Otherwise the buffer is compared to the current checked-in version of the file.
      If NON-INTERACTIVE-P, put the results in a buffer and switch to that buffer;
      otherwise run ediff to view the differences.

  (ss-branch)
      Branch off a private, writable copy of the current file for you to work on.
      You can merge this back in later on by using the function (ss-merge).
      This makes a note of the current baseline file, so merging can use a
      more intelligent three-way merge.

      If the current file is already checked out, converts the file
      to a private branch and unchecks out the file.

  (ss-unbranch)
      Deletes a private branch, abandoning all changes you have made.

  (ss-merge)
      Check out the current file and merge in the changes that you have made.
      See the function (ss-branch).
      If given a prefix argument, merge in the changes without checking out the file.

  (ss-history)
      Display the SourceSafe checkin history for the current file in a buffer.

  (ss-status)
      Display the SourceSafe status of the current file.

  (ss-locate)
      Find a file in SourceSafe.

  (ss-submit-bug-report)
      Submit a bug report, with pertinent information.

  (ss-help)
      Print out this help text.

There are a number of variables of interest:

  ss-program
      Value is " (format "%S" ss-program) ".
      The pathname of the SourceSafe program.  Default is \"SS.exe\".

  ss-project-dirs
      Specifies how to convert NT file names to project names.  The
      value is a list of pairs of the form
        (FILENAME-REGEXP . PROJECT)
      To create the project filename from a Windows filename, the list
      is searched for the first FILENAME-REGEXP that matches the
      filename.  The part of the filename that matched is then replaced
      by the PROJECT, and then all backslashes are converted to
      forward slashes.

      Note: You must use either the forward slash \\ or the backward
      slash / as the directory sepr character in the FILENAME-REGEXP.

      For example, you might set ss-project-dirs like this:

        (setq ss-project-dirs '((\"^C:\\\\\\\\MyProjDir\\\\\\\\\" . \"$/MyProj/\")
			        (\"^D:\\\\\\\\MyProjDir\\\\\\\\\" . \"$/MyProj/\")
				(\"^E:\\\\\\\\MyProjDir\\\\\\\\\" . \"$/MyProj/\")
				(\"^C:/MyProj/\" . \"$/MyProj/\")
				(\"^D:/MyProj/\" . \"$/MyProj/\")
				(\"^E:/MyProj/\" . \"$/MyProj/\")))

      Beware!  Since those are regexp patterns, you need to have lots of
      \\ characters in there.

  ss-username
      Value is " (format "%S" ss-username) ".
      Your SourceSafe user name.  Defaults to your current login name.

  ss-password
      Value is " (if (stringp ss-password) "******" (format "%S" ss-password)) ".
      Your SourceSafe Password.  If NIL, no password is used.  If a string,
      it will be used as your password.  Otherwise, you will be prompted the
      first time for the password to use.

  ss-database-alist
      List associating pathnames with SourceSafe databases.
      This is useful if you are using multiple databases.
      Each item on the list is a pair of the form (DIR-REGEXP . DATABASE)
      where DIR-REGEXP is a regular expression that matches a directory,
      and DATABASE is the value to set the env variable SSDIR to when manipulating
      any file that matches DIR_REGEXP.

      If NIL (the default), the SSDIR env variable is not modified.

      The DIR_REGEXP can use either the forward slash \\ character or
      the backward slash / as a directory separator.

      Note that each DIR_REGEXP should probably start with a ^,
      and that you will probably need to use a large number of \\ characters.

  ss-update-email-to
      Value is " (format "%S" ss-update-email-to) ".
      If not NULL, when you checkin a file (or should I say \"update\"\?),
      emacs automatically creates a mail message addressed to the value
      of this variable, indicating the file name and the checkin
      message.  Subsequent checkins add their info to the message.

      You might set ss-update-email-to like this:

        (setq ss-update-email-to \"my-proj-eng\")

  ss-update-email-cc
      Value is " (format "%S" ss-update-email-cc) ".
      Like ss-update-email-to, but the default CC: list for mail.

  ss-update-email-subject
      Value is " (format "%S" ss-update-email-subject) ".
      Default text for the subject line for update email messages.

  ss-update-email-body
      Default initial text for the body of update email messages.

  ss-diff-ignore-whitespace
      Value is " (format "%S" ss-diff-ignore-whitespace) ".
      If TRUE (the default), ss-diff will ignore trivial differences like whitespace.

  ss-diff-program
      Value is " (format "%S" ss-diff-program) ".
      External program and arguments to generate diff against the
      current version.   The value is a list of the form (PROGRAM . ARGS).
      Possible values for PROGRAM and their meanings are:
	  SS	-- Use SourceSafe to generate the diff.  The ARGS are
		   passed to SourceSafe.
	  DIFF	-- Use the Emacs function (diff old new ARGS).

  ss-update-new-frame
      Value is " (format "%S" ss-update-new-frame) ".
      If a list, ss-update will open a new window (\"frame\" in Emacs terminology)
      to edit the checkin message, using the value as the parameters to make-frame.
      If T, open a new frame with the default make-frame parameters.
      If NULL, edit the checkin message in the existing frame.
      This can be very useful if you follow ss-update by a call to ss-diff:
      you can then step through the changes to the file as a guide to constructing
      the checkin message.

  ss-tmp-dir
      Value is " (format "%S" ss-tmp-dir) ".
      The name of a directory where Emacs and SourceSafe can create directories
      for temporary files.  If NIL (the default), emacs will create a directory
      at the root of your project tree.  Since SourceSafe sometimes has problems
      dealing with FAT file systems, the default is most certainly what you want.

  ss-before-update-hooks
  ss-after-update-hooks
      Hooks to call before/after a SourceSafe UPDATE command.

  ss-ediff-split-window-function
      Setting for ediff-split-window-function when invoked by ss commands.

  ss-multiple-checkouts-enabled nil
      Source-safe has multiple checkouts enabled.
