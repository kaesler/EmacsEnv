;;; Commentary:

;; Provides a facility to update a (possibly remote) copy of the
;; current buffer either automatically (by setting
;; `mirror-update-on-save') or on demand (via the function
;; `mirror-update-this-file').  Just how this happens is determined by
;; a series of buffer local variables.  Since it is very lightweight
;; and makes few assumptions about the remote mirror files and hosts
;; it can handle certain situations that `ange-ftp' or `tramp' cannot
;; (yet).

;;; Installation:

;; Place the following somewhere in your .emacs file

;;  (require 'mirror)

;; and set one or more of the following in the local variables section
;; of a file you wish to mirror (see the bottom of this file for
;; example).

;; `mirror-file-path': set this to the full path (including filename)
;; to the mirror file.  Note that the mirror file need not have the
;; same name as the local file.  This can be useful for getting around
;; suffix conventions on different machines (eg .html versus .HTM).

;; `mirror-file-host': set this to the name of the remote host on
;; which the mirror file resides.  If this is nil (the default) then
;; the file is assumed to reside on the same file system and hence the
;; emacs lisp function `copy-file' is used to perform the update.  If
;; this variable is non-nil then a remote connection to the host is
;; established using `mirror-sftp-command'.

;; `mirror-sftp-command': set this to the shell command used to
;; establish a remote connection to `mirror-file-host'. The default is
;; "sftp".  This remote session will persist throughout your emacs
;; session and the same session will be used to update any mirror
;; files on that host.  You may also have to set
;; `mirror-password-prompt-regexp' `mirror-login-prompt-regexp' and
;; `mirror-prompt-regexp' to get this to work.

;; `mirror-time-to-connection': set this to the amount of time you are
;; willing to wait for a connection to the remote host to be
;; established.  The default is 10 seconds which is usually enough,
;; but you can set it higher for connections you expect to be
;; especially slow.

;; `mirror-update-command': set this to the command that should be
;; passed to `mirror-sftp-command' whenever a the mirror file is to be
;; updated. The default is "put". This command must take two
;; arguments: the full path to the current file and the full path to
;; the remote file.

;; `mirror-update-on-save': if this is non-nil then the mirror file
;; will automatically be updated whenever the buffer is saved. The
;; default is nil. This facility is most useful when you wish to edit
;; files on a remote system where using `tramp' or `ange-ftp' are too
;; slow or just don't work, for example, editing files on a Windows
;; 2000 server (not running CygWin) from a UNIX machine (this was the
;; original motivation for the package).
