;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Purpose of this package:
;;   1. Offer a function for letting the user choose buffer,
;;      not necessarily for switching to it.
;;   2. Make a better mouse-buffer-menu.
;;
;; Installation:

;;   1. Byte compile msb first.  It uses things in the cl package that
;;      are slow if not compiled, but blazingly fast when compiled.  I
;;      have also had one report that said that msb malfunctioned when
;;      not compiled.
;;   2. (require 'msb)
;;      Note! You now use msb instead of mouse-buffer-menu.
;;   3. Now try the menu bar Buffers menu.
;;
;; Customization:
;;   Look at the variable `msb-menu-cond' for deciding what menus you
;;   want.  It's not that hard to customize, despite my not-so-good
;;   doc-string.  Feel free to send me a better doc-string.
;;   There are some constants for you to try here:
;;   msb--few-menus
;;   msb--very-many-menus (default)
;;   
;;   Look at the variable `msb-item-handling-function' for customization
;;   of the appearance of every menu item.  Try for instance setting
;;   it to `msb-alon-item-handler'.
;;   
;;   Look at the variable `msb-item-sort-function' for customization
;;   of sorting the menus.  Set it to t for instance, which means no
;;   sorting - you will get latest used buffer first.
;;
;;   Also check out the variable `msb-display-invisible-buffers-p'.

;; Known bugs:
;; - Files-by-directory
;;   + No possibility to show client/changed buffers separately
;; Future enhancements:
;; - [Mattes] had a suggestion about sorting files by extension.
;;   I (Lars Lindberg) think this case could be solved if msb.el was
;;   rewritten to handle more dynamic splitting.  It's now completely
;;   static, depending on the menu-cond.  If the splitting could also
;;   be done by a user-defined function a lot of cases would be
;;   solved.
;; - [Jim] suggested that the Frame menu became a part of the buffer menu.

The elements in the list should be of this type:
 (CONDITION MENU-SORT-KEY MENU-TITLE ITEM-HANDLING-FN ITEM-SORT-FN).

When making the split, the buffers are tested one by one against the
CONDITION, just like a lisp cond: When hitting a true condition, the
other criterias are *not* tested and the buffer name will appear in
the menu with the menu-title corresponding to the true condition.

If the condition returns the symbol `multi', then the buffer will be
added to this menu *and* tested for other menus too.  If it returns
`no-multi', then the buffer will only be added if it hasn't been added
to any other menu.

During this test, the buffer in question is the current buffer, and
the test is surrounded by calls to `save-excursion' and
`save-match-data'.

The categories are sorted by MENU-SORT-KEY.  Smaller keys are on
top.  nil means don't display this menu.

MENU-TITLE is really a format.  If you add %d in it, the %d is replaced
with the number of items in that menu.

ITEM-HANDLING-FN, is optional.  If it is supplied and is a
function, than it is used for displaying the items in that particular
buffer menu, otherwise the function pointed out by
`msb-item-handling-function' is used.

ITEM-SORT-FN, is also optional.
If it is not supplied, the function pointed out by
`msb-item-sort-function' is used.
If it is nil, then no sort takes place and the buffers are presented
in least-recently-used order.
If it is t, then no sort takes place and the buffers are presented in
most-recently-used order.
If it is supplied and non-nil and not t than it is used for sorting
the items in that particular buffer menu.

Note1: There should always be a `catch-all' as last element,
in this list.  That is an element like (t TITLE ITEM-HANDLING-FUNCTION).
Note2: A buffer menu appears only if it has at least one buffer in it.
Note3: If you have a CONDITION that can't be evaluated you will get an
error every time you do \\[msb].")
