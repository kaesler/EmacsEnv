Push mark at LOCATION, and unconditionally add to `global-mark-ring'.

This function differs from `push-mark' in that `global-mark-ring'
is always updated.

LOCATION is optional, and defaults to the current point.

NOMSG and ACTIVATE are as documented at `push-mark'.

When CONSECUTIVES is set to 'limit and the new mark is in the same
buffer as the first entry in `global-mark-ring', the first entry
in `global-mark-ring' will be replaced.  Otherwise, a new entry
is pushed onto `global-mark-ring'.

When CONSECUTIVES is set to 'allow-dupes, it is possible to push
an exact duplicate of the current topmost mark onto `global-mark-ring'.

(defvar back-button-mode nil "\
Non-nil if Back-Button mode is enabled.
See the `back-button-mode' command
for a description of this minor mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')
or call the function `back-button-mode'.")

Turn on back-button-mode.

When called interactively with no prefix argument this command
toggles the mode.  With a prefix argument, it enables the mode
if the argument is positive and otherwise disables the mode.

When called from Lisp, this command enables the mode if the
argument is omitted or nil, and toggles the mode if the argument
is 'toggle.

Navigate through `mark-ring', using `back-button-pop-local-mark'.

motion occurs.

direction.  (The \"forward\" direction by analogy with a
web browser back-button.)
