Emacs-IDE (eide) is a package for Emacs that provides IDE features
(Integrated Development Environment).

Although most of these features are already available in Emacs,
the purpose of this package is to integrate them into a user-friendly
interface, with dedicated windows (source files, menu, and ouput),
convenient keyboard shortcuts, and project management.

It is suitable for almost all languages (as long as they are supported by
Ctags). Cscope provides additional browsing facility for C/C++ files.
