This package may be useful if youâ€™d just like to encrypt parts of
files or buffers, and to have encrypted output in the same line as
other unencrypted text.

This package relies on the openssl command-line utility. If openssl
isn't in your PATH, customize the `inline-crypt-openssl-command'
variable to point to it.

The four interactive commands that will interest you are
`inline-crypt-encrypt-region', `inline-crypt-decrypt-region',
`inline-crypt-encrypt-string', and `inline-crypt-decrypt-string'.
