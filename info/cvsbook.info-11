File: cvsbook.info,  Node: config,  Next: cvsignore,  Prev: commitinfo,  Up: Repository Administrative Files

config
------

Controls various global (non-project-specific) repository parameters.
The syntax of each line is

     ParameterName=yes|no

except for the LockDir parameter, which takes an absolute pathname as
argument.

The following parameters are supported:

   * RCSBIN (default: `=no') - (Obsolete) This option is silently
     accepted for backwards compatibility, but no longer has any effect.

   * SystemAuth (default: `=no') - If `yes', CVS pserver authentication
     tries the system user database - usually `/etc/passwd' - if a
     username is not found in `CVSROOT/passwd'.  If `no', the user must
     exist in `CVSROOT/passwd' to gain access via the `:pserver:'
     method.

   * PreservePermissions (default: `=no') - If `yes', CVS tries to
     preserve permissions and other special file system information
     (such as device numbers and symbolic link targets) for files.  You
     probably don't want to do this, as it does not necessarily behave
     as expected. (See the node `Special Files' in the Cederqvist
     manual for details.)

   * TopLevelAdmin (default: `=no') - If `yes', checkouts create a
     `CVS/' subdirectory next to each working copy tree (in the parent
     directory of the working copy).  This can be useful if you will be
     checking out many working copies from the same repository; on the
     other hand, setting it here affects everyone who uses this
     repository.

   * LockDir (unset by default) - The argument after the equal sign is a
     path to a directory in which CVS can create lockfiles.  If not set,
     lockfiles are created in the repository, in locations
     corresponding to each project's RCS files.  This means that users
     of those projects must have file-system-level write access to
     those repository directories.



File: cvsbook.info,  Node: cvsignore,  Next: cvswrappers,  Prev: config,  Up: Repository Administrative Files

cvsignore
---------

Ignores certain files when doing updates, imports, or releases.  By
default, CVS already ignores some kinds of files. (For a full list, see
the -I option to import, earlier in this chapter.)  You can add to this
list by putting additional file names or wildcard patterns in the
cvsignore file.  Each line gives a file name or pattern, for example:

     README.msdos
     *.html
     blah?.out

This causes CVS to ignore any file named `README.msdos', any file
ending in `.html', and any file beginning with `blah' and ending with
`.out'.  (Technically, you can name multiple files or patterns on each
line, separated by whitespace, but it is more readable to keep them to
one per line.  The whitespace separation rule does, unfortunately, mean
that there's no way to specify a space in a file name, except to use
wildcards.)

A `!' anywhere in the list cancels all previous entries.  (See *Note
$CVSIGNORE:: in the section *Note Environment Variables:: in this
chapter for a fuller discussion of ignore processing.)


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: cvswrappers,  Next: editinfo,  Prev: cvsignore,  Up: Repository Administrative Files

cvswrappers
-----------

Specifies certain filtering behaviors based on file name.  Each line has
a file-globbing pattern (that is, a file name or file wildcards),
followed by an option indicating the filter type and an argument for the
option.

Options:

   * -m - Specifies an update method.  Possible arguments are MERGE,
     which means to merge changes into working files automatically, and
     COPY, which means don't try to automerge but present the user with
     both versions of the file and let them work it out.  MERGE is the
     default, except for binary files (those whose keyword substitution
     mode is -kb).  (See the *Note Keyword Substitution (RCS
     Keywords):: section in this chapter.)  Files marked as binary
     automatically use the COPY method, so there is no need to make a
     -m COPY wrapper for them.

   * -k - Specifies a keyword substitution mode.  All of the usual
     modes are possible.  (See the *Note Keyword Substitution (RCS
     Keywords):: section in this chapter for a complete list.)


Here is an example cvswrappers file:

     *.blob    -m COPY
     *.blink   -k o

This cvswrappers file says to not attempt merges on files ending in
`.blob' and suppress keyword substitution for files ending in `.blink'.
(See also the file `.cvswrappers' in the *Note Working Copy Files::
section in this chapter.)


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: editinfo,  Next: history file,  Prev: cvswrappers,  Up: Repository Administrative Files

editinfo
--------

This file is obsolete.  Very.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: history file,  Next: loginfo,  Prev: editinfo,  Up: Repository Administrative Files

history file
------------

Stores an ever-accumulating history of activity in the repository, for
use by the cvs history command.  To disable this feature, simply remove
the history file.  If you don't remove the file, you should probably
make it world-writeable to avoid permission problems later.

The contents of this file do not modify CVS's behavior in any way
(except for the output of cvs history, of course).


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: loginfo,  Next: modules,  Prev: history file,  Up: Repository Administrative Files

loginfo
-------

Specifies programs to run on the log message for each commit, based on
what's being committed.  Each line consists of a regular expression
followed by a command template:

     REGULAR_EXPRESSION PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS]

The PROGRAM is passed the log message on its standard input.

Several special codes are available for use in the arguments: `%s'
expands to the names of the files being committed, `%V' expands to the
old revisions from before the commit, and `%v' expands to the new
revisions after the commit.  When there are multiple files involved,
each element of the expansion is separated from the others by
whitespace.  For example, in a commit involving two files, `%s' might
expand into `hello.c README.txt', and `%v' into `1.17 1.12'.

You may combine codes inside curly braces, in which case, each unit of
expansion is internally separated by commas and externally separated
from the other units by whitespace.  Continuing the previous example,
`%{sv}' expands into `hello.c,1.17 README.txt,1.12'.

If any `%' expansion is done at all, the expansion is prefixed by the
path to the project subdirectory (relative to the top of the
repository).  So that last expansion would actually be:

     myproj  hello.c,1.17  README.txt,1.12

If PROGRAM exits with nonzero status, the commit fails; otherwise, it
succeeds.  (See also the *Note Shared Syntax:: section in this chapter.)


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: modules,  Next: notify,  Prev: loginfo,  Up: Repository Administrative Files

modules
-------

This maps names to repository directories.  The general syntax of each
line is:

     MODULE [OPTIONS] [&OTHERMODULE...] [DIR] [FILES]

DIR need not be a top-level project directory - it could be a
subdirectory.  If any FILES are specified, the module consists of only
those files from the directory.

An ampersand followed by a module name means to include the expansion of
that module's line in place.

Options:

   * -a - This is an "alias" module, meaning it expands literally to
     everything after the OPTIONS.  In this case, the usual DIR/FILES
     behavior is turned off, and everything after the OPTIONS is
     treated as other modules or repository directories.

     If you use the -a option, you may exclude certain directories from
     other modules by putting them after an exclamation point (!).  For
     example

          top_proj -a !myproj/a-subdir !myproj/b-subdir myproj

     means that checking out `top_proj' will get all of `myproj' except
     `a-subdir' and `b-subdir'.

   * -d NAME - Names the working directory NAME instead of the module
     name.

   * -e PROGRAM - Runs PROGRAM whenever files in this module are
     exported.

   * -i PROGRAM - Runs PROGRAM whenever files in this module are
     committed.  The program is given a single argument - the full
     pathname in the repository of the file in question. (See *Note
     commitinfo::, *Note loginfo::, and *Note verifymsg:: for more
     sophisticated ways to run commit-triggered programs.)

   * -o PROGRAM - Runs PROGRAM whenever files in this module are checked
     out.  The program is given a single argument, the name of the
     module.

   * -s STATUS - Declares a status for the module.  When the modules
     file is printed (with cvs checkout -s), the modules are sorted by
     module status and then by name.  This option has no other effects
     in CVS, so go wild.  You can use it to sort anything - status,
     person responsible for the module, or the module's file language,
     for example.

   * -t PROGRAM - Runs PROGRAM whenever files in this module are tagged
     with cvs rtag.  The program is passed two arguments: the name of
     the module and the tag name.  The program is not used for tag,
     only for rtag.  I have no idea why this distinction is made.  You
     may find the taginfo file more useful if you want to run programs
     at tag time.

   * -u PROGRAM - Runs PROGRAM whenever a working copy of the module is
     updated from its top-level directory.  The program is given a
     single argument, the full path to the module's repository.



File: cvsbook.info,  Node: notify,  Next: passwd,  Prev: modules,  Up: Repository Administrative Files

notify
------

Controls how the notifications for watched files are performed. (You may
want to read up on the watch and edit commands, or see the section
*Note Watches (CVS As Telephone):: in *Note Advanced CVS::.)  Each line
is of the usual form:

REGULAR_EXPRESSION PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS]

A `%s' in ARGUMENTS is expanded to the name of the user to be notified,
and the rest of the information regarding the notification is passed to
PROGRAM on standard input (usually this information is a brief message
suitable for emailing to the user).  (See the section *Note Shared
Syntax:: earlier in this chapter.)

As shipped with CVS, the notify file has one line

     ALL mail %s -s "CVS notification"

which is often all you need.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: passwd,  Next: rcsinfo,  Prev: notify,  Up: Repository Administrative Files

passwd
------

Provides authentication information for the pserver access method.  Each
line is of the form:

USER:ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD[:SYSTEM_USER]

If no SYSTEM_USER is given, USER is taken as the system username.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: rcsinfo,  Next: taginfo,  Prev: passwd,  Up: Repository Administrative Files

rcsinfo
-------

Specifies a form that should be filled out for log messages that are
written with an interactive editor.  Each line of rcsinfo looks like:

REGULAR_EXPRESSION FILE_CONTAINING_TEMPLATE

This template is brought to remote working copies at checkout time, so
if the template file or rcsinfo file changes after checkout, the remote
copies won't know about it and will continue to use the old template.
(See also the section *Note Shared Syntax:: in this chapter.)


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: taginfo,  Next: users,  Prev: rcsinfo,  Up: Repository Administrative Files

taginfo
-------

Runs a program at tag time (usually done to check that the tag name
matches some pattern).  Each line is of the form:

REGULAR_EXPRESSION PROGRAM

The program is handed a set group of arguments.  In order, they are the
tag name, the operation (see below), the repository, and then as many
file name/revision-number pairs as there are files involved in the tag.
The file/revision pairs are separated by whitespace, like the rest of
the arguments.

The operation is one of `add', `mov', or `del' (`mov' means the -F
option to tag was used).

If PROGRAM exits with nonzero status, the tag operation will not
succeed.  (See also the section *Note Shared Syntax:: in this chapter.)


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: users,  Next: val-tags,  Prev: taginfo,  Up: Repository Administrative Files

users
-----

Maps usernames to email addresses.  Each line looks like:

USERNAME:EMAIL_ADDRESS

This sends watch notifications to EMAIL_ADDRESS instead of to USERNAME
at the repository machine.  (All this really does is control the
expansion of %s in the notify file.)  If EMAIL_ADDRESS includes
whitespace, make sure to surround it with quotes.

If user aliasing is being used in the passwd file, the username that
will be matched is the CVS username (the one on the left), not the
system username (the one on the right, if any).


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: val-tags,  Next: verifymsg,  Prev: users,  Up: Repository Administrative Files

val-tags
--------

Caches valid tag names for speedier lookups.  You should never need to
edit this file, but you may need to change its permissions, or even
ownership, if people are having trouble retrieving or creating tags.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: verifymsg,  Prev: val-tags,  Up: Repository Administrative Files

verifymsg
---------

Used in conjunction with rcsinfo to verify the format of log messages.
Each line is of the form:

REGULAR_EXPRESSION PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS]

The full path to the current log message template (see *Note rcsinfo::
earlier in this chapter) is appended after the last argument written in
the verifymsg file.  If PROGRAM exits with nonzero status, the commit
fails.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: Run Control Files,  Next: Working Copy Files,  Prev: Repository Administrative Files,  Up: CVS Reference

Run Control Files
=================

There are a few files on the client (working copy) side that affect
CVS's behavior.  In some cases, they are analogs of repository
administrative files; in other cases, they control behaviors that are
only appropriate for the client side.

`.cvsrc'
--------

Specifies options that you want to be used automatically with every CVS
command.  The format of each line is

COMMAND OPTIONS

where each COMMAND is an unabbreviated CVS command, such as checkout or
update (but not co or up).  The OPTIONS are those that you want to
always be in effect when you run that command.  Here is a common
`.cvsrc' line:

     update -d -P

To specify global options, simple use cvs as the COMMAND.

`.cvsignore'
------------

Specifies additional ignore patterns.  (See *Note cvsignore:: in the
*Note Repository Administrative Files:: section in this chapter for the
syntax.)

You can have a .cvsignore file in your home directory, which will apply
every time you use CVS.  You can also have directory-specific ones in
each project directory of a working copy (these last only apply to the
directory where the .cvsignore is located, and not to its
subdirectories).

(See *Note $CVSIGNORE:: in the section *Note Environment Variables:: in
this chapter, for a fuller discussion of ignore processing.)

`.cvspass'
----------

Stores passwords for each repository accessed via the pserver method.
Each line is of the form:

REPOSITORY LIGHTLY_SCRAMBLED_PASSWORD

The password is essentially stored in cleartext - a very mild
scrambling is done to prevent accidental compromises (such as the root
user unintentionally looking inside the file).  However, this scrambling
will not deter any serious-minded person from gaining the password if
they get access to the file.

The .cvspass file is portable.  You can copy it from one machine to
another and have all of your passwords at the new machine, without ever
having run cvs login there.  (See also the *Note login:: and *Note
logout:: commands.)

`.cvswrappers'
--------------

This is a client side version of the cvswrappers file.  (See the *Note
Repository Administrative Files:: section in this chapter.)  There can
be a `.cvswrappers' file in your home directory and in each directory
of a working copy directory, just as with `.cvsignore'.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: Working Copy Files,  Next: Environment Variables,  Prev: Run Control Files,  Up: CVS Reference

Working Copy Files
==================

The CVS/ administrative subdirectories in each working copy contain some
subset of the following files.

   * CVS/Base/

   * CVS/Baserev

   * CVS/Baserev.tmp

   * CVS/Checkin.prog

   * CVS/Entries

   * CVS/Entries.Backup

   * CVS/Entries.Log

   * CVS/Entries.Static

   * CVS/Notify

   * CVS/Notify.tmp

   * CVS/Repository

   * CVS/Root

   * CVS/Tag

   * CVS/Template

   * CVS/Update.prog

Here is what each file or directory does:

`CVS/Base/'  (directory)
------------------------

If watches are on, `cvs edit' stores the original copy of the file in
this directory.  That way, `cvs unedit' can work even if it can't reach
the server.

`CVS/Baserev'
-------------

Lists the revision for each file in `Base/'.  Each line looks like this:

     FILE/REVISION/EXPANSION

EXPANSION is currently ignored to allow for, well, future expansion.

`CVS/Baserev.tmp'
-----------------

This is the temp file for the preceding.  (See `CVS/Notify.tmp' or
`CVS/Entries.Backup' later on for further explanation.)

`CVS/Checkin.prog'
------------------

Records the name of the program specified by the -i option in the
modules file.  (See the *Note Repository Administrative Files:: section
in this chapter.)

`CVS/Entries'
-------------

Stores the revisions for the files in this directory.  Each line is of
the form:

     [CODE_LETTER]/FILE/REVISION/DATE/[KEYWORD_MODE]/[STICKY_OPTION]

If CODE_LETTER is present, it must be `D' for directory (anything else
is silently ignored by CVS, to allow for future expansion), and the
rest of the items on the line are absent.

This file is always present.

`CVS/Entries.Backup'
--------------------

This is just a temp file.  If you're writing some program to modify the
`Entries' file, have it write the new contents to `Entries.backup' and
then atomically rename it to `Entries'.

`CVS/Entries.Log'
-----------------

This is basically a patch file to be applied to `Entries' after
`Entries' has been read (this is an efficiency hack, to avoid having to
rewrite all of `Entries' for every little change).  The format is the
same as `Entries', except that there is an additional mandatory code
letter at the front of every line: An `A' means this line is to be
added to what's in `Entries'; `R' means it's to be removed from what's
in `Entries'.  Any other letters should be silently ignored, to allow
for future expansion.

`CVS/Entries.Static'
--------------------

If this file exists, it means only part of the directory was fetched
from the repository, and CVS will not create additional files in that
directory.  This condition can usually be cleared by using `update -d'.

`CVS/Notify'
------------

Stores notifications that have not yet been sent to the server.

`CVS/Notify.tmp'
----------------

Temp file for `Notify'.  The usual procedure for modifying `Notify' is
to write out `Notify.tmp' and then rename it to `Notify'.

`CVS/Repository'
----------------

The path to the project-specific subdirectory in the repository.  This
may be an absolute path, or it may be relative to the path given in
Root.

This file is always present.

`CVS/Root'
----------

This is the repository; that is, the value of the `$CVSROOT'
environment variable or the argument to the -d global option.

This file is always present.

`CVS/Tag'
---------

If there is a sticky tag or date on this directory, it is recorded in
the first line of the file.  The first character is a single letter
indicating the type of tag: `T', `N', or `D', for branch tag, nonbranch
tag, or date respectively.  The rest of the line is the tag or date
itself.

`CVS/Template'
--------------

Contains a log message template as specified by the rcsinfo file.  (See
*Note Repository Administrative Files:: earlier in this chapter.)  It
is relevant only for remote working copies; working copies on the same
machine as the repository just read rcsinfo directly.

`CVS/Update.prog'
-----------------

Records the name of the program specified by the -u option in the
modules file.  (See the *Note Repository Administrative Files:: section
in this chapter.)


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: Environment Variables,  Prev: Working Copy Files,  Up: CVS Reference

Environment Variables
=====================

These are all the environment variables that affect CVS.

* Menu:

* $COMSPEC::
* $CVS_CLIENT_LOG::
* $CVS_CLIENT_PORT::

* $PATH::
* $TEMP $TMP $TMPDIR::
* $VISUAL::


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $COMSPEC,  Next: $CVS_CLIENT_LOG,  Up: Environment Variables

$COMSPEC
--------

This is used in OS/2 only; it specifies the name of the command
interpreter.  It defaults to `CMD.EXE'.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $CVS_CLIENT_LOG,  Next: $CVS_CLIENT_PORT,  Prev: $COMSPEC,  Up: Environment Variables

$CVS_CLIENT_LOG
---------------

Used for debugging the client/server protocol.  Set this variable to a
file name before you start using CVS; all traffic to the server will be
logged in filename.in, and everything from the server will be logged in
filename.out.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $CVS_CLIENT_PORT,  Next: $CVSEDITOR,  Prev: $CVS_CLIENT_LOG,  Up: Environment Variables

$CVS_CLIENT_PORT
----------------

Used in Kerberos-authenticated client/server access.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $CVSEDITOR,  Next: $CVSIGNORE,  Prev: $CVS_CLIENT_PORT,  Up: Environment Variables

$CVSEDITOR
----------

Specifies the program to use to edit log messages for commits.  This
overrides `$EDITOR' and `$VISUAL'.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $CVSIGNORE,  Next: $CVS_IGNORE_REMOTE_ROOT,  Prev: $CVSEDITOR,  Up: Environment Variables

$CVSIGNORE
----------

A whitespace-separated list of file names and wildcard patterns that CVS
should ignore.  (See also the -I option to the *Note import:: command.)

This variable is appended last to the ignore list during a command.  The
list is built up in this order: `CVSROOT/cvsignore', the `.cvsignore'
file in your home directory, the `$CVSIGNORE' variable, any -I command
option, and finally the contents of `.cvsignore' files in the working
copy used as CVS works in each directory.  A `!' as the ignore
specification at any point nullifies the entire ignore list built up to
that point.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $CVS_IGNORE_REMOTE_ROOT,  Next: $CVS_PASSFILE,  Prev: $CVSIGNORE,  Up: Environment Variables

$CVS_IGNORE_REMOTE_ROOT
-----------------------

Recently obsolete.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $CVS_PASSFILE,  Next: $CVS_RCMD_PORT,  Prev: $CVS_IGNORE_REMOTE_ROOT,  Up: Environment Variables

$CVS_PASSFILE
-------------

Tells CVS to use some file other than .cvspass in your home directory.
(See the file `.cvspass' in the *Note Run Control Files:: section in
this chapter.)


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $CVS_RCMD_PORT,  Next: $CVSREAD,  Prev: $CVS_PASSFILE,  Up: Environment Variables

$CVS_RCMD_PORT
--------------

Specifies the port number to contact the rcmd daemon on the server side.
(This variable is currently ignored in Unix CVS clients.)


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $CVSREAD,  Next: $CVSROOT,  Prev: $CVS_RCMD_PORT,  Up: Environment Variables

$CVSREAD
--------

Makes working copy files read-only on checkout and update, if possible
(the default is for them to be read-write).  (See also the -r global
option.)


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $CVSROOT,  Next: $CVS_RSH,  Prev: $CVSREAD,  Up: Environment Variables

$CVSROOT
--------

This specifies the path to the repository.  This is overridden with the
-d global option and by the ambient repository for a given working copy.
The path to the repository may be preceded by an access method,
username, and host, according to the following syntax:

     [[:METHOD:][[USER@]HOST]:]/REPOSITORY_PATH

See the -d global option, in the section *Note Global Options:: near
the beginning of this chapter, for a list of valid methods.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $CVS_RSH,  Next: $CVS_SERVER,  Prev: $CVSROOT,  Up: Environment Variables

$CVS_RSH
--------

Specifies an external program for connecting to the server when using
the `:ext:' access method.  Defaults to `rsh', but `ssh' is a common
replacement value.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $CVS_SERVER,  Next: $CVS_SERVER_SLEEP,  Prev: $CVS_RSH,  Up: Environment Variables

$CVS_SERVER
-----------

Program to invoke for CVS on the server side.  Defaults to `cvs', of
course.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $CVS_SERVER_SLEEP,  Next: $CVSUMASK,  Prev: $CVS_SERVER,  Up: Environment Variables

$CVS_SERVER_SLEEP
-----------------

Delays the start of the server child process by the specified number of
seconds.  This is used only for debugging, to allow time for a debugger
to connect.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $CVSUMASK,  Next: $CVSWRAPPERS,  Prev: $CVS_SERVER_SLEEP,  Up: Environment Variables

$CVSUMASK
---------

Permissions for files and directories in the repository.  (You probably
don't want to set this; it doesn't work for client/server anyway.)


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $CVSWRAPPERS,  Next: $EDITOR,  Prev: $CVSUMASK,  Up: Environment Variables

$CVSWRAPPERS
------------

A whitespace-separated list of file names, wildcards, and arguments that
CVS should use as wrappers. (See *Note cvswrappers:: in the *Note
Repository Administrative Files:: section in this chapter for more
information.)


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $EDITOR,  Next: $HOME %HOMEDRIVE% %HOMEPATH%,  Prev: $CVSWRAPPERS,  Up: Environment Variables

$EDITOR
-------

(See *Note $CVSEDITOR::.)


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $HOME %HOMEDRIVE% %HOMEPATH%,  Next: $PATH,  Prev: $EDITOR,  Up: Environment Variables

$HOME %HOMEDRIVE% %HOMEPATH%
----------------------------

Where the `.cvsrc', `.cvspass', and other such files are found (under
Unix, only `$HOME' is used).  In Windows NT, `%HOMEDRIVE%' and
`%HOMEPATH%' might be set for you; in Windows 95, you may need to set
them for yourself.

In Windows 95, you may also need to set `%HOME%'.  Make sure not to
give it a trailing backslash; use set `HOME=C:' or something similar.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $PATH,  Next: $TEMP $TMP $TMPDIR,  Prev: $HOME %HOMEDRIVE% %HOMEPATH%,  Up: Environment Variables

$PATH
-----

Obsolete.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: $TEMP $TMP $TMPDIR,  Next: $VISUAL,  Prev: $PATH,  Up: Environment Variables

$TEMP $TMP $TMPDIR
------------------

Where temporary files go (the server uses TMPDIR; Windows NT uses TMP).
Setting this on the client side will not affect the server.  Setting
this on either side will not affect where CVS stores temporary lock
files.  (See *Note config:: in the *Note Repository Administrative
Files:: section in this chapter for more information.)

Third-Party Tools
*****************

Many people have written programs to augment CVS.  I call these
"third-party tools" because they have their own maintainers, separate
from the CVS development team.  Most of these programs are not
distributed with CVS, although some are.  This chapter covers
third-party tools that I have found useful, but that are not distributed
with CVS.

Although there are some very popular and widely used non-command-line or
non-Unix interfaces to CVS (download sites are listed in *Note
Repository Administration::), this chapter does not discuss most of
them.  Their popularity makes it easy to find out more about them from
mailing lists and newsgroups.  One exception to this is the Emacs
pcl-cvs interface, which is very useful, but sometimes tricky to
install.

pcl-cvs - An Emacs Interface To CVS
===================================

Depends on: Emacs, Elib

URLs:

   * `ftp://rum.cs.yale.edu/pub/monnier/pcl-cvs/'

   * `ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/emacs/pcl-cvs-1.05.tar.gz'

   * `ftp://ftp.red-bean.com/pub/kfogel/pcl-cvs-1.05.tar.gz'

Authors: Per Cederqvist and Stefan Monnier (current maintainer)

`pcl-cvs' is one of two Emacs/CVS interfaces.  The other is the native
VC (Version Control) interface built into Emacs.  I prefer pcl-cvs
because it was written exclusively for CVS and, therefore, works
smoothly with the CVS way of doing things.  VC, on the other hand, was
designed to work with several different back-end version control systems
- RCS and SCCS, as well as CVS - and is not really "tuned" for CVS.
For example, VC presents a file-based rather than a directory-based
interface to revision control.

The advantages of pcl-cvs are strong enough that many people choose to
download and install it rather than use VC.  Unfortunately, pcl-cvs has
two disadvantages: It can be a bit tricky to install (much of this
section is devoted to overcoming possible installation hurdles), and its
recent releases are a bit unstable.

The latter problem is likely to be temporary, but it does raise the
question of which version to use.  Stefan Monnier has just recently
taken over the pcl-cvs maintainership; the latest release, 2.9.6
(available from the first URL in the preceding list), was a bit bumpy
when I tried it.  No doubt the problems will be smoothed out soon, but
in the meantime, you might want to use an older version.  Because I've
been using Version 1.05 daily for a long time now and it's performed
quite well, I'm going to document that version here.  Fortunately, the
installation procedures don't change much from version to version.  If
you decide to use pcl-cvs, I suggest that you check Monnier's download
site for a version newer than 2.9.6; if there is one, try it out before
regressing all the way to 1.05.

You'll notice that two URLs are given for Version 1.05.  The first is
Per Cederqvist's site, where he still makes available an old archive of
pcl-cvs.  However, since I'm not sure how much longer his archive will
stay around, I'm also making the 1.05 distribution available from
ftp.red-bean.com.

Although the rest of these instructions use examples from a Version 1.05
distribution, they should apply to later versions as well.

Installing pcl-cvs
------------------

If you don't normally deal with Emacs installation and site-maintenance
issues, the pcl-cvs installation procedure may seem a bit daunting.  A
little background on how Emacs works may help.

Most higher-level Emacs features are written in a language called "Emacs
Lisp" (Emacs itself is essentially an interpreter for this language).
People add new features to Emacs by distributing files of Emacs Lisp
code.  `pcl-cvs' is written in this language, and it depends on a
library of useful, generic Emacs Lisp functions called "Elib" (also
written in part by Per Cederqvist, but distributed separately from
pcl-cvs).

Elib is not included in the regular Emacs distribution (at least not FSF
Emacs; I don't know about XEmacs), so you may have to download and
install it yourself before you can use pcl-cvs.  You can get it from
`ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/emacs/elib-1.0.tar.gz'.  Installation
instructions are contained within the package.

Once Elib is installed, you're ready to build and install pcl-cvs.
These instructions applies both to Version 1.05 and the 2.x series
(although you should check the NEWS and INSTALL files in newer
distributions to see what's changed).

First, unpack pcl-cvs (I'm using Version 1.05, but it could just as
easily have been 2.9.6)

     floss$ zcat pcl-cvs-1.05.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     pcl-cvs-1.05/
     pcl-cvs-1.05/README
     pcl-cvs-1.05/NEWS
     pcl-cvs-1.05/INSTALL
     pcl-cvs-1.05/ChangeLog
     pcl-cvs-1.05/pcl-cvs.el
     pcl-cvs-1.05/pcl-cvs.texinfo
     pcl-cvs-1.05/compile-all.el
     pcl-cvs-1.05/pcl-cvs-lucid.el
     pcl-cvs-1.05/pcl-cvs-startup.el
     pcl-cvs-1.05/pcl-cvs.info
     pcl-cvs-1.05/Makefile
     pcl-cvs-1.05/texinfo.tex

and go into the source tree's top level:

     floss$ cd pcl-cvs-1.05/

A Makefile is supplied there.  According to the instructions in the
INSTALL file, you're supposed to edit a few paths at the top of the
Makefile and then run:

     floss$ make install

If that works, great.  However, this sometimes results in an error (the
pcl-cvs code itself is very portable, but its installation procedures
sometimes are not).  Do this if you get an error:

     floss$ make clean
     floss$ make

If all goes well, these commands accomplish a significant part of the
installation by byte-compiling all of the Emacs Lisp files.
(Byte-compiling converts a file of human-readable Emacs Lisp code - an
.el file - into a more compact and efficient representation - an .elc
file.  Emacs can load and run an .elc file with better performance than
it can a plain .el file.)

I'll proceed as though the byte-compilation stage has succeeded.  If the
byte compilation does not appear to succeed, don't worry: The .elc files
are a luxury, not a necessity.  They improve performance slightly, but
you can run pcl-cvs from the raw .el files with no problem.

If the make install failed, the next step is to get the Emacs Lisp
(whether .el or .elc) into a directory where Emacs can load it
automatically.  Emacs has a designated directory on the system for
locally installed Lisp.  To find this directory - it will have a file
named `default.el' in it - check the following locations, in this order:

  1. /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/

  2. /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/

  3. /usr/lib/emacs/site-lisp/

  4. /usr/local/lib/emacs/site-lisp/

Once you've found your site-lisp directory, copy all of the Lisp files
to it (you may have to be root to do this):

     floss# cp -f *.el *.elc /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/

The last step is to tell Emacs about the entry points to pcl-cvs (the
main one being the function cvs-update), so it will know to load the
pcl-cvs code on demand.  Because Emacs always reads the default.el file
when it starts up, that's where you need to list the pcl-cvs entry
points.

Fortunately, pcl-cvs provides the necessary content for default.el.
Simply put the contents of pcl-cvs-startup.el into default.el (or
perhaps into your .emacs, if you're just installing this for yourself)
and restart your Emacs.

You may also want to copy the .info files into your info tree and add
pcl-cvs to the table of contents in the dir file.

Using pcl-cvs
-------------

Once installed, pcl-cvs is very easy to use.  You just run the function
cvs-update, and pcl-cvs brings up a buffer showing what files in your
working copy have been modified or updated.  From there, you can commit,
do diffs, and so on.

Because cvs-update is the main entry point, I suggest that you bind it
to a convenient key sequence before going any further.  I have it bound
to `Ctrl+c v' in my .emacs:

     (global-set-key "\C-cv" 'cvs-update)

Otherwise, you can run it by typing `M-x cvs-update' (also known as
`Esc-x cvs-update').

When invoked, cvs-update runs cvs update as if in the directory of the
file in the current buffer - just as if you typed cvs update on the
command line in that directory.  Here's an example of what you might see
inside Emacs:

     PCL-CVS release 1.05 from CVS release $Name:  $.
     Copyright (C) 1992, 1993 Per Cederqvist
     Pcl-cvs comes with absolutely no warranty; for details consult the manual.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain
     conditions; again, consult the TeXinfo manual for details.
      Modified ci README.txt
      Modified ci fish.c
     ---------- End ----

Two files have been locally modified (some versions of pcl-cvs show the
subdirectories where the files are located).  The next logical action is
to commit one or both of the files, which is what the ci on each line
means.  To commit one of them, go to its line and type `c'.  You are
brought to a log message buffer, where you can type a log message as
long as you want (real log message editing is the major advantage of
pcl-cvs over the command line).  Type `Ctrl+c Ctrl+c' when done to
complete the commit.

If you want to commit multiple files at once, sharing a log message,
first use m to mark the files that you intend to commit.  An asterisk
appears next to each file as you mark it:

     PCL-CVS release 1.05 from CVS release $Name:  $.
     Copyright (C) 1992, 1993 Per Cederqvist
     Pcl-cvs comes with absolutely no warranty; for details consult the manual.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain
     conditions; again, consult the TeXinfo manual for details.
     * Modified ci README.txt
     * Modified ci fish.c
     ---------- End ----

Now when you type c anywhere, it applies to all (and only) the marked
files.  Write the log message and commit them with `Ctrl+c Ctrl+c' as
before.

You can also type `d' to run cvs diff on a file (or on marked files)
and `f' to bring a file into Emacs for editing.  Other commands are
available; type `Ctrl+h' m in the update buffer to see what else you
can do.

Error Handling In pcl-cvs
-------------------------

The pcl-cvs program has historically had an odd way of dealing with
error and informational messages from CVS (although this may be
corrected in the latest versions).  When it encounters a message from
CVS that it doesn't know about, it gets hysterical and throws you into a
mail buffer, ready to send a pregenerated bug report to the author of
pcl-cvs.  Unfortunately, among the CVS messages that pcl-cvs may not
know about are the ones associated with conflicting merges, which,
although not common, certainly do occur from time to time.

If pcl-cvs suddenly dumps you into a mail buffer, don't panic.  Read
over the contents of the buffer carefully - the offending CVS output
should be in there somewhere.  If it looks like a merge, you can just
get rid of the mail buffer and rerun cvs-update.  It should now succeed,
because CVS won't output any merge messages (because the merge has
already taken place).

(Update: this problem appears to have been fixed in more recent versions
of pcl-cvs, so very probably you can ignore this entire warning.)

The Future Of pcl-cvs
---------------------

Although I may be giving you the impression that pcl-cvs is barely
maintained and a risky investment, the instability appears to be
temporary.  Stefan Monnier is a responsive maintainer (I contacted him
several times during the writing of this chapter, and he always answered
right away; he is already making headway on some of the bugs in Version
2.9.6).  Very likely by the time this is published, you will be able to
download Version 2.9.7 or later with confidence.

In fact, I just now got an encouraging email on this topic from Greg
Woods, a former maintainer of pcl-cvs, reprinted here with his
permission:

     From: woods@most.weird.com (Greg A. Woods)
     Subject: Re: pcl-cvs maintenance status, stability of recent "release"s?
     To: kfogel@red-bean.com
     Date: Sun, 29 Aug 1999 18:59:19 -0400 (EDT)
     
     [...]
     I've been using Stefan's releases for some time now, and indeed I have
     abandoned my own branch of it.
     
     He's done a lot of really good work on PCL-CVS and except for a few odd
     quirks in the 2.9.6 version I'm using daily now it is quite usable (and
     is approximately infinitely more usable with modern CVS than the one
     that was in the CVS distribution! ;-).
     
     I've added a pcl-cvs.README file to my FTP site to point out that the
     files there are indeed quite old (at least in Internet time! ;-) and to
     give a pointer to Stefan's FTP site too.
     
     [...]

In a later email, Greg said that the FSF is considering including
pcl-cvs in their next release of Emacs (20.5), which would render most
of the preceding installation advice obsolete.  Sigh.  It's hard to keep
up with free software, sometimes.

cvsutils - General Utilities For Use With CVS
=============================================

Depends on: Perl

URLs:

   * `http://www.red-bean.com/cvsutils'

Authors: Tom Tromey (original author) and Pavel Roskin (current
maintainer)

The suite of small programs called `cvsutils' generally (although not
always) performs "offline" operations in the CVS working copy.  Offline
operations are those that can be done without contacting the
repository, while still leaving the working copy in a consistent state
for the next time the repository is contacted.  Offline behavior can be
extremely handy when your network connection to the repository is slow
or unreliable.

The cvsutils programs are listed below in approximate order of
usefulness (according to my opinion), with the more useful ones coming
first.  Coincidentally, this also arranges them by safety.  Safety is an
issue because some of these utilities can, in their normal course of
operation, cause you to lose local modifications or files from your
working copy.  Therefore, read the descriptions carefully before using
these utilities.

This documentation is accurate as of Version 0.1.4.  Be sure to read the
README file in any later versions for more up-to-date information.

cvsu
----

Danger level: None

Contacts repository: No

This does an offline cvs update by comparing the timestamps of files on
disk with their timestamps recorded in CVS/Entries.  You can thus tell
which files have been locally modified and which files are not known to
be under CVS control.  Unlike `cvs update', cvsu does not bring down
changes from the repository.

Although it can take various options, cvsu is most commonly invoked
without any options:

     floss$ cvsu
     ? ./bar
     ? ./chapter-10.html
     M ./chapter-10.sgml
     D ./out
     ? ./safe.sh
     D ./tools

The left-side codes are like the output of cvs update, except that `D'
means directory.  This example shows that chapter-10.sgml has been
modified locally.  What the example doesn't show is that cvsu ran
instantly, whereas a normal cvs update would have required half a minute
or so over my slow modem line.  Run

     floss$ cvsu --help

to see a list of options.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: cvsdo,  Next: cvschroot,  Prev: cvsu,  Up: cvsutils -- General Utilities For Use With CVS

cvsdo
-----

Danger level: Low to none

Contacts repository: No

This can simulate the working copy effects of cvs add and cvs remove,
but without contacting the repository.  Of course, you'd still have to
commit the changes to make them take effect in the repository, but at
least the add and remove commands themselves can be sped up this way.
Here's how to use it

     floss$ cvsdo add FILENAME

or

     floss$ cvsdo remove FILENAME

To see a list of further options, run:

     floss$ cvsdo --help


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: cvschroot,  Next: cvsrmadm,  Prev: cvsdo,  Up: cvsutils -- General Utilities For Use With CVS

cvschroot
---------

Danger level: Low

Contacts repository: No

This deals with a repository move by tweaking the working copy to point
to the new repository.  This is useful when a repository is copied en
masse to a new location.  When that happens, none of the revisions are
affected, but the CVS/Root (and possibly the CVS/Repository) file of
every working copy must be updated to point to the new location.  Using
cvschroot is a lot faster than checking out a new copy.  Another
advantage is that it doesn't lose your local changes.

Usage:

     floss$ cvschroot NEW_REPOS

For example:

     floss$ cvschroot :pserver:newuser@newhost.wherever.com:/home/cvs/myproj


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: cvsrmadm,  Next: cvspurge,  Prev: cvschroot,  Up: cvsutils -- General Utilities For Use With CVS

cvsrmadm
--------

Danger level: Low to medium

Contacts repository: No

This removes all of the CVS/ administrative subdirectories in your
working copy, leaving behind a tree similar to that created by cvs
export.

Although you won't lose any local changes by using cvsrmadm, your
working copy will no longer be a working copy.

Use with caution.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: cvspurge,  Next: cvsdiscard,  Prev: cvsrmadm,  Up: cvsutils -- General Utilities For Use With CVS

cvspurge
--------

Danger level: Medium

This removes all non-CVS-controlled files in your working copy.  It does
not undo any local changes to CVS-controlled files.

Use with caution.


File: cvsbook.info,  Node: cvsdiscard,  Next: cvsco,  Prev: cvspurge,  Up: cvsutils -- General Utilities For Use With CVS

cvsdiscard
----------

Danger level: Medium to high

Contacts repository: Maybe

This is the complement of cvspurge.  Instead of removing unknown files
but keeping your local changes, cvsdiscard undoes any local changes
(replacing those files with fresh copies from the repository), but keeps
unknown files.

Use with extreme caution.

This is the union of cvspurge and cvsdiscard.  It undoes any local
changes and removes unknown files from the working copy.

Use with truly paranoid caution.
