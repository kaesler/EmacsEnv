File Format Conversion
======================

   The variable `format-alist' defines a list of "file formats", which
describe textual representations used in files for the data (text,
text-properties, and possibly other information) in an Emacs buffer.
Emacs performs format conversion if appropriate when reading and writing
files.

 - Variable: format-alist
     This list contains one format definition for each defined file
     format.

   Each format definition is a list of this form:

     (NAME DOC-STRING REGEXP FROM-FN TO-FN MODIFY MODE-FN)

   Here is what the elements in a format definition mean:

NAME
     The name of this format.

DOC-STRING
     A documentation string for the format.

REGEXP
     A regular expression which is used to recognize files represented
     in this format.

FROM-FN
     A shell command or function to decode data in this format (to
     convert file data into the usual Emacs data representation).

     A shell command is represented as a string; Emacs runs the command
     as a filter to perform the conversion.

     If FROM-FN is a function, it is called with two arguments, BEGIN
     and END, which specify the part of the buffer it should convert.
     It should convert the text by editing it in place.  Since this can
     change the length of the text, FROM-FN should return the modified
     end position.

     One responsibility of FROM-FN is to make sure that the beginning
     of the file no longer matches REGEXP.  Otherwise it is likely to
     get called again.

TO-FN
     A shell command or function to encode data in this format--that
     is, to convert the usual Emacs data representation into this
     format.

     If TO-FN is a string, it is a shell command; Emacs runs the
     command as a filter to perform the conversion.

     If TO-FN is a function, it is called with two arguments, BEGIN and
     END, which specify the part of the buffer it should convert.
     There are two ways it can do the conversion:

        * By editing the buffer in place.  In this case, TO-FN should
          return the end-position of the range of text, as modified.

        * By returning a list of annotations.  This is a list of
          elements of the form `(POSITION . STRING)', where POSITION is
          an integer specifying the relative position in the text to be
          written, and STRING is the annotation to add there.  The list
          must be sorted in order of position when TO-FN returns it.

          When `write-region' actually writes the text from the buffer
          to the file, it intermixes the specified annotations at the
          corresponding positions.  All this takes place without
          modifying the buffer.

MODIFY
     A flag, `t' if the encoding function modifies the buffer, and
     `nil' if it works by returning a list of annotations.

MODE-FN
     A minor-mode function to call after visiting a file converted from
     this format.  The function is called with one argument, the
     integer 1; that tells a minor-mode function to enable the mode.

   The function `insert-file-contents' automatically recognizes file
formats when it reads the specified file.  It checks the text of the
beginning of the file against the regular expressions of the format
definitions, and if it finds a match, it calls the decoding function for
that format.  Then it checks all the known formats over again.  It
keeps checking them until none of them is applicable.

   Visiting a file, with `find-file-noselect' or the commands that use
it, performs conversion likewise (because it calls
`insert-file-contents'); it also calls the mode function for each
format that it decodes.  It stores a list of the format names in the
buffer-local variable `buffer-file-format'.

 - Variable: buffer-file-format
     This variable states the format of the visited file.  More
     precisely, this is a list of the file format names that were
     decoded in the course of visiting the current buffer's file.  It
     is always buffer-local in all buffers.

   When `write-region' writes data into a file, it first calls the
encoding functions for the formats listed in `buffer-file-format', in
the order of appearance in the list.

 - Command: format-write-file file format
     This command writes the current buffer contents into the file FILE
     in format FORMAT, and makes that format the default for future
     saves of the buffer.  The argument FORMAT is a list of format
     names.

 - Command: format-find-file file format
     This command finds the file FILE, converting it according to
     format FORMAT.  It also makes FORMAT the default if the buffer is
     saved later.

     The argument FORMAT is a list of format names.  If FORMAT is
     `nil', no conversion takes place.  Interactively, typing just
     <RET> for FORMAT specifies `nil'.

 - Command: format-insert-file file format &optional beg end
     This command inserts the contents of file FILE, converting it
     according to format FORMAT.  If BEG and END are non-`nil', they
     specify which part of the file to read, as in
     `insert-file-contents' (*note Reading from Files::).

     The return value is like what `insert-file-contents' returns: a
     list of the absolute file name and the length of the data inserted
     (after conversion).

     The argument FORMAT is a list of format names.  If FORMAT is
     `nil', no conversion takes place.  Interactively, typing just
     <RET> for FORMAT specifies `nil'.

 - Variable: auto-save-file-format
     This variable specifies the format to use for auto-saving.  Its
     value is a list of format names, just like the value of
     `buffer-file-format'; however, it is used instead of
     `buffer-file-format' for writing auto-save files.  This variable is
     always buffer-local in all buffers.

Backups and Auto-Saving
***********************

   Backup files and auto-save files are two methods by which Emacs tries
to protect the user from the consequences of crashes or of the user's
own errors.  Auto-saving preserves the text from earlier in the current
editing session; backup files preserve file contents prior to the
current session.

* Menu:

* Backup Files::   How backup files are made; how their names are chosen.
* Auto-Saving::    How auto-save files are made; how their names are chosen.
* Reverting::      `revert-buffer', and how to customize what it does.

Backup Files
============

   A "backup file" is a copy of the old contents of a file you are
editing.  Emacs makes a backup file the first time you save a buffer
into its visited file.  Normally, this means that the backup file
contains the contents of the file as it was before the current editing
session.  The contents of the backup file normally remain unchanged once
it exists.

   Backups are usually made by renaming the visited file to a new name.
Optionally, you can specify that backup files should be made by copying
the visited file.  This choice makes a difference for files with
multiple names; it also can affect whether the edited file remains owned
by the original owner or becomes owned by the user editing it.

   By default, Emacs makes a single backup file for each file edited.
You can alternatively request numbered backups; then each new backup
file gets a new name.  You can delete old numbered backups when you
don't want them any more, or Emacs can delete them automatically.

* Menu:

* Making Backups::     How Emacs makes backup files, and when.
* Rename or Copy::     Two alternatives: renaming the old file or copying it.
* Numbered Backups::   Keeping multiple backups for each source file.
* Backup Names::       How backup file names are computed; customization.

Making Backup Files
-------------------

 - Function: backup-buffer
     This function makes a backup of the file visited by the current
     buffer, if appropriate.  It is called by `save-buffer' before
     saving the buffer the first time.

 - Variable: buffer-backed-up
     This buffer-local variable indicates whether this buffer's file has
     been backed up on account of this buffer.  If it is non-`nil', then
     the backup file has been written.  Otherwise, the file should be
     backed up when it is next saved (if backups are enabled).  This is
     a permanent local; `kill-all-local-variables' does not alter it.

 - User Option: make-backup-files
     This variable determines whether or not to make backup files.  If
     it is non-`nil', then Emacs creates a backup of each file when it
     is saved for the first time--provided that `backup-inhibited' is
     `nil' (see below).

     The following example shows how to change the `make-backup-files'
     variable only in the Rmail buffers and not elsewhere.  Setting it
     `nil' stops Emacs from making backups of these files, which may
     save disk space.  (You would put this code in your init file.)

          (add-hook 'rmail-mode-hook
                    (function (lambda ()
                                (make-local-variable
                                 'make-backup-files)
                                (setq make-backup-files nil))))

 - Variable: backup-enable-predicate
     This variable's value is a function to be called on certain
     occasions to decide whether a file should have backup files.  The
     function receives one argument, a file name to consider.  If the
     function returns `nil', backups are disabled for that file.
     Otherwise, the other variables in this section say whether and how
     to make backups.

     The default value is `normal-backup-enable-predicate', which checks
     for files in `temporary-file-directory' and
     `small-temporary-file-directory'.

 - Variable: backup-inhibited
     If this variable is non-`nil', backups are inhibited.  It records
     the result of testing `backup-enable-predicate' on the visited file
     name.  It can also coherently be used by other mechanisms that
     inhibit backups based on which file is visited.  For example, VC
     sets this variable non-`nil' to prevent making backups for files
     managed with a version control system.

     This is a permanent local, so that changing the major mode does
     not lose its value.  Major modes should not set this
     variable--they should set `make-backup-files' instead.

 - Variable: backup-directory-alist
     This variable's value is an alist of filename patterns and backup
     directory names.  Each element looks like
          (REGEXP . DIRECTORY)

     Backups of files with names matching REGEXP will be made in
     DIRECTORY.  DIRECTORY may be relative or absolute.  If it is
     absolute, so that all matching files are backed up into the same
     directory, the file names in this directory will be the full name
     of the file backed up with all directory separators changed to `!'
     to prevent clashes.  This will not work correctly if your
     filesystem truncates the resulting name.

     For the common case of all backups going into one directory, the
     alist should contain a single element pairing `"."' with the
     appropriate directory name.

     If this variable is `nil', or it fails to match a filename, the
     backup is made in the original file's directory.

     On MS-DOS filesystems without long names this variable is always
     ignored.

 - Variable: make-backup-file-name-function
     This variable's value is a function to use for making backups
     instead of the default `make-backup-file-name'.  A value of nil
     gives the default `make-backup-file-name' behaviour.

     This could be buffer-local to do something special for specific
     files.  If you define it, you may need to change
     `backup-file-name-p' and `file-name-sans-versions' too.


File: elisp,  Node: Rename or Copy,  Next: Numbered Backups,  Prev: Making Backups,  Up: Backup Files

Backup by Renaming or by Copying?
---------------------------------

   There are two ways that Emacs can make a backup file:

   * Emacs can rename the original file so that it becomes a backup
     file, and then write the buffer being saved into a new file.
     After this procedure, any other names (i.e., hard links) of the
     original file now refer to the backup file.  The new file is owned
     by the user doing the editing, and its group is the default for
     new files written by the user in that directory.

   * Emacs can copy the original file into a backup file, and then
     overwrite the original file with new contents.  After this
     procedure, any other names (i.e., hard links) of the original file
     continue to refer to the current (updated) version of the file.
     The file's owner and group will be unchanged.

   The first method, renaming, is the default.

   The variable `backup-by-copying', if non-`nil', says to use the
second method, which is to copy the original file and overwrite it with
the new buffer contents.  The variable `file-precious-flag', if
non-`nil', also has this effect (as a sideline of its main
significance).  *Note Saving Buffers::.

 - Variable: backup-by-copying
     If this variable is non-`nil', Emacs always makes backup files by
     copying.

   The following two variables, when non-`nil', cause the second method
to be used in certain special cases.  They have no effect on the
treatment of files that don't fall into the special cases.

 - Variable: backup-by-copying-when-linked
     If this variable is non-`nil', Emacs makes backups by copying for
     files with multiple names (hard links).

     This variable is significant only if `backup-by-copying' is `nil',
     since copying is always used when that variable is non-`nil'.

 - Variable: backup-by-copying-when-mismatch
     If this variable is non-`nil', Emacs makes backups by copying in
     cases where renaming would change either the owner or the group of
     the file.

     The value has no effect when renaming would not alter the owner or
     group of the file; that is, for files which are owned by the user
     and whose group matches the default for a new file created there
     by the user.

     This variable is significant only if `backup-by-copying' is `nil',
     since copying is always used when that variable is non-`nil'.

 - Variable: backup-by-copying-when-privileged-mismatch
     This variable, if non-`nil', specifies the same behavior as
     `backup-by-copying-when-mismatch', but only for certain user-id
     values: namely, those less than or equal to a certain number.  You
     set this variable to that number.

     Thus, if you set `backup-by-copying-when-privileged-mismatch' to
     0, backup by copying is done for the superuser only, when
     necessary to prevent a change in the owner of the file.

     The default is 200.


File: elisp,  Node: Numbered Backups,  Next: Backup Names,  Prev: Rename or Copy,  Up: Backup Files

Making and Deleting Numbered Backup Files
-----------------------------------------

   If a file's name is `foo', the names of its numbered backup versions
are `foo.~V~', for various integers V, like this: `foo.~1~', `foo.~2~',
`foo.~3~', ..., `foo.~259~', and so on.

 - User Option: version-control
     This variable controls whether to make a single non-numbered backup
     file or multiple numbered backups.

    `nil'
          Make numbered backups if the visited file already has
          numbered backups; otherwise, do not.

    `never'
          Do not make numbered backups.

    ANYTHING ELSE
          Make numbered backups.

   The use of numbered backups ultimately leads to a large number of
backup versions, which must then be deleted.  Emacs can do this
automatically or it can ask the user whether to delete them.

 - User Option: kept-new-versions
     The value of this variable is the number of newest versions to keep
     when a new numbered backup is made.  The newly made backup is
     included in the count.  The default value is 2.

 - User Option: kept-old-versions
     The value of this variable is the number of oldest versions to keep
     when a new numbered backup is made.  The default value is 2.

   If there are backups numbered 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, and both of these
variables have the value 2, then the backups numbered 1 and 2 are kept
as old versions and those numbered 5 and 7 are kept as new versions;
backup version 3 is excess.  The function `find-backup-file-name'
(*note Backup Names::) is responsible for determining which backup
versions to delete, but does not delete them itself.

 - User Option: delete-old-versions
     If this variable is `t', then saving a file deletes excess backup
     versions silently.  If it is `nil', that means to ask for
     confirmation before deleting excess backups.  Otherwise, they are
     not deleted at all.

 - User Option: dired-kept-versions
     This variable specifies how many of the newest backup versions to
     keep in the Dired command `.' (`dired-clean-directory').  That's
     the same thing `kept-new-versions' specifies when you make a new
     backup file.  The default value is 2.


File: elisp,  Node: Backup Names,  Prev: Numbered Backups,  Up: Backup Files

Naming Backup Files
-------------------

   The functions in this section are documented mainly because you can
customize the naming conventions for backup files by redefining them.
If you change one, you probably need to change the rest.

 - Function: backup-file-name-p filename
     This function returns a non-`nil' value if FILENAME is a possible
     name for a backup file.  A file with the name FILENAME need not
     exist; the function just checks the name.

          (backup-file-name-p "foo")
               => nil
          (backup-file-name-p "foo~")
               => 3

     The standard definition of this function is as follows:

          (defun backup-file-name-p (file)
            "Return non-nil if FILE is a backup file \
          name (numeric or not)..."
            (string-match "~\\'" file))

     Thus, the function returns a non-`nil' value if the file name ends
     with a `~'.  (We use a backslash to split the documentation
     string's first line into two lines in the text, but produce just
     one line in the string itself.)

     This simple expression is placed in a separate function to make it
     easy to redefine for customization.

 - Function: make-backup-file-name filename
     This function returns a string that is the name to use for a
     non-numbered backup file for file FILENAME.  On Unix, this is just
     FILENAME with a tilde appended.

     The standard definition of this function, on most operating
     systems, is as follows:

          (defun make-backup-file-name (file)
            "Create the non-numeric backup file name for FILE..."
            (concat file "~"))

     You can change the backup-file naming convention by redefining this
     function.  The following example redefines `make-backup-file-name'
     to prepend a `.' in addition to appending a tilde:

          (defun make-backup-file-name (filename)
            (expand-file-name
              (concat "." (file-name-nondirectory filename) "~")
              (file-name-directory filename)))
          
          (make-backup-file-name "backups.texi")
               => ".backups.texi~"

     Some parts of Emacs, including some Dired commands, assume that
     backup file names end with `~'.  If you do not follow that
     convention, it will not cause serious problems, but these commands
     may give less-than-desirable results.

 - Function: find-backup-file-name filename
     This function computes the file name for a new backup file for
     FILENAME.  It may also propose certain existing backup files for
     deletion.  `find-backup-file-name' returns a list whose CAR is the
     name for the new backup file and whose CDR is a list of backup
     files whose deletion is proposed.

     Two variables, `kept-old-versions' and `kept-new-versions',
     determine which backup versions should be kept.  This function
     keeps those versions by excluding them from the CDR of the value.
     *Note Numbered Backups::.

     In this example, the value says that `~rms/foo.~5~' is the name to
     use for the new backup file, and `~rms/foo.~3~' is an "excess"
     version that the caller should consider deleting now.

          (find-backup-file-name "~rms/foo")
               => ("~rms/foo.~5~" "~rms/foo.~3~")

 - Function: file-newest-backup filename
     This function returns the name of the most recent backup file for
     FILENAME, or `nil' if that file has no backup files.

     Some file comparison commands use this function so that they can
     automatically compare a file with its most recent backup.


File: elisp,  Node: Auto-Saving,  Next: Reverting,  Prev: Backup Files,  Up: Backups and Auto-Saving

Auto-Saving
===========

   Emacs periodically saves all files that you are visiting; this is
called "auto-saving".  Auto-saving prevents you from losing more than a
limited amount of work if the system crashes.  By default, auto-saves
happen every 300 keystrokes, or after around 30 seconds of idle time.
*Note Auto-Save: (emacs)Auto-Save, for information on auto-save for
users.  Here we describe the functions used to implement auto-saving
and the variables that control them.

 - Variable: buffer-auto-save-file-name
     This buffer-local variable is the name of the file used for
     auto-saving the current buffer.  It is `nil' if the buffer should
     not be auto-saved.

          buffer-auto-save-file-name
               => "/xcssun/users/rms/lewis/#backups.texi#"

 - Command: auto-save-mode arg
     When used interactively without an argument, this command is a
     toggle switch: it turns on auto-saving of the current buffer if it
     is off, and vice versa.  With an argument ARG, the command turns
     auto-saving on if the value of ARG is `t', a nonempty list, or a
     positive integer.  Otherwise, it turns auto-saving off.

 - Function: auto-save-file-name-p filename
     This function returns a non-`nil' value if FILENAME is a string
     that could be the name of an auto-save file.  It assumes the usual
     naming convention for auto-save files: a name that begins and ends
     with hash marks (`#') is a possible auto-save file name.  The
     argument FILENAME should not contain a directory part.

          (make-auto-save-file-name)
               => "/xcssun/users/rms/lewis/#backups.texi#"
          (auto-save-file-name-p "#backups.texi#")
               => 0
          (auto-save-file-name-p "backups.texi")
               => nil

     The standard definition of this function is as follows:

          (defun auto-save-file-name-p (filename)
            "Return non-nil if FILENAME can be yielded by..."
            (string-match "^#.*#$" filename))

     This function exists so that you can customize it if you wish to
     change the naming convention for auto-save files.  If you redefine
     it, be sure to redefine the function `make-auto-save-file-name'
     correspondingly.

 - Function: make-auto-save-file-name
     This function returns the file name to use for auto-saving the
     current buffer.  This is just the file name with hash marks (`#')
     prepended and appended to it.  This function does not look at the
     variable `auto-save-visited-file-name' (described below); callers
     of this function should check that variable first.

          (make-auto-save-file-name)
               => "/xcssun/users/rms/lewis/#backups.texi#"

     The standard definition of this function is as follows:

          (defun make-auto-save-file-name ()
            "Return file name to use for auto-saves \
          of current buffer.."
            (if buffer-file-name
                (concat
                 (file-name-directory buffer-file-name)
                 "#"
                 (file-name-nondirectory buffer-file-name)
                 "#")
              (expand-file-name
               (concat "#%" (buffer-name) "#"))))

     This exists as a separate function so that you can redefine it to
     customize the naming convention for auto-save files.  Be sure to
     change `auto-save-file-name-p' in a corresponding way.

 - Variable: auto-save-visited-file-name
     If this variable is non-`nil', Emacs auto-saves buffers in the
     files they are visiting.  That is, the auto-save is done in the
     same file that you are editing.  Normally, this variable is `nil',
     so auto-save files have distinct names that are created by
     `make-auto-save-file-name'.

     When you change the value of this variable, the new value does not
     take effect in an existing buffer until the next time auto-save
     mode is reenabled in it.  If auto-save mode is already enabled,
     auto-saves continue to go in the same file name until
     `auto-save-mode' is called again.

 - Function: recent-auto-save-p
     This function returns `t' if the current buffer has been
     auto-saved since the last time it was read in or saved.

 - Function: set-buffer-auto-saved
     This function marks the current buffer as auto-saved.  The buffer
     will not be auto-saved again until the buffer text is changed
     again.  The function returns `nil'.

 - User Option: auto-save-interval
     The value of this variable specifies how often to do auto-saving,
     in terms of number of input events.  Each time this many
     additional input events are read, Emacs does auto-saving for all
     buffers in which that is enabled.

 - User Option: auto-save-timeout
     The value of this variable is the number of seconds of idle time
     that should cause auto-saving.  Each time the user pauses for this
     long, Emacs does auto-saving for all buffers in which that is
     enabled.  (If the current buffer is large, the specified timeout
     is multiplied by a factor that increases as the size increases;
     for a million-byte buffer, the factor is almost 4.)

     If the value is zero or nil, then auto-saving is not done as a
     result of idleness, only after a certain number of input events as
     specified by `auto-save-interval'.

 - Variable: auto-save-hook
     This normal hook is run whenever an auto-save is about to happen.

 - User Option: auto-save-default
     If this variable is non-`nil', buffers that are visiting files
     have auto-saving enabled by default.  Otherwise, they do not.

 - Command: do-auto-save &optional no-message current-only
     This function auto-saves all buffers that need to be auto-saved.
     It saves all buffers for which auto-saving is enabled and that
     have been changed since the previous auto-save.

     Normally, if any buffers are auto-saved, a message that says
     `Auto-saving...' is displayed in the echo area while auto-saving is
     going on.  However, if NO-MESSAGE is non-`nil', the message is
     inhibited.

     If CURRENT-ONLY is non-`nil', only the current buffer is
     auto-saved.

 - Function: delete-auto-save-file-if-necessary
     This function deletes the current buffer's auto-save file if
     `delete-auto-save-files' is non-`nil'.  It is called every time a
     buffer is saved.

 - Variable: delete-auto-save-files
     This variable is used by the function
     `delete-auto-save-file-if-necessary'.  If it is non-`nil', Emacs
     deletes auto-save files when a true save is done (in the visited
     file).  This saves disk space and unclutters your directory.

 - Function: rename-auto-save-file
     This function adjusts the current buffer's auto-save file name if
     the visited file name has changed.  It also renames an existing
     auto-save file.  If the visited file name has not changed, this
     function does nothing.

 - Variable: buffer-saved-size
     The value of this buffer-local variable is the length of the
     current buffer, when it was last read in, saved, or auto-saved.
     This is used to detect a substantial decrease in size, and turn
     off auto-saving in response.

     If it is -1, that means auto-saving is temporarily shut off in
     this buffer due to a substantial decrease in size.  Explicitly
     saving the buffer stores a positive value in this variable, thus
     reenabling auto-saving.  Turning auto-save mode off or on also
     updates this variable, so that the substantial decrease in size is
     forgotten.

 - Variable: auto-save-list-file-name
     This variable (if non-`nil') specifies a file for recording the
     names of all the auto-save files.  Each time Emacs does
     auto-saving, it writes two lines into this file for each buffer
     that has auto-saving enabled.  The first line gives the name of
     the visited file (it's empty if the buffer has none), and the
     second gives the name of the auto-save file.

     When Emacs exits normally, it deletes this file; if Emacs crashes,
     you can look in the file to find all the auto-save files that
     might contain work that was otherwise lost.  The `recover-session'
     command uses this file to find them.

     The default name for this file specifies your home directory and
     starts with `.saves-'.  It also contains the Emacs process ID and
     the host name.

 - Variable: auto-save-list-file-prefix
     After Emacs reads your init file, it initializes
     `auto-save-list-file-name' (if you have not already set it
     non-`nil') based on this prefix, adding the host name and process
     ID.  If you set this to `nil' in your init file, then Emacs does
     not initialize `auto-save-list-file-name'.

Reverting
=========

   If you have made extensive changes to a file and then change your
mind about them, you can get rid of them by reading in the previous
version of the file with the `revert-buffer' command.  *Note Reverting
a Buffer: (emacs)Reverting.

 - Command: revert-buffer &optional ignore-auto noconfirm
     This command replaces the buffer text with the text of the visited
     file on disk.  This action undoes all changes since the file was
     visited or saved.

     By default, if the latest auto-save file is more recent than the
     visited file, and the argument IGNORE-AUTO is `nil',
     `revert-buffer' asks the user whether to use that auto-save
     instead.  When you invoke this command interactively, IGNORE-AUTO
     is `t' if there is no numeric prefix argument; thus, the
     interactive default is not to check the auto-save file.

     Normally, `revert-buffer' asks for confirmation before it changes
     the buffer; but if the argument NOCONFIRM is non-`nil',
     `revert-buffer' does not ask for confirmation.

     Reverting tries to preserve marker positions in the buffer by
     using the replacement feature of `insert-file-contents'.  If the
     buffer contents and the file contents are identical before the
     revert operation, reverting preserves all the markers.  If they
     are not identical, reverting does change the buffer; in that case,
     it preserves the markers in the unchanged text (if any) at the
     beginning and end of the buffer.  Preserving any additional
     markers would be problematical.

   You can customize how `revert-buffer' does its work by setting the
variables described in the rest of this section.

 - Variable: revert-without-query
     This variable holds a list of files that should be reverted without
     query.  The value is a list of regular expressions.  If the
     visited file name matches one of these regular expressions, and
     the file has changed on disk but the buffer is not modified, then
     `revert-buffer' reverts the file without asking the user for
     confirmation.

   Some major modes customize `revert-buffer' by making buffer-local
bindings for these variables:

 - Variable: revert-buffer-function
     The value of this variable is the function to use to revert this
     buffer.  If non-`nil', it is called as a function with no
     arguments to do the work of reverting.  If the value is `nil',
     reverting works the usual way.

     Modes such as Dired mode, in which the text being edited does not
     consist of a file's contents but can be regenerated in some other
     fashion, can give this variable a buffer-local value that is a
     function to regenerate the contents.

 - Variable: revert-buffer-insert-file-contents-function
     The value of this variable, if non-`nil', specifies the function
     to use to insert the updated contents when reverting this buffer.
     The function receives two arguments: first the file name to use;
     second, `t' if the user has asked to read the auto-save file.

     The reason for a mode to set this variable instead of
     `revert-buffer-function' is to avoid duplicating or replacing the
     rest of what `revert-buffer' does: asking for confirmation,
     clearing the undo list, deciding the proper major mode, and
     running the hooks listed below.

 - Variable: before-revert-hook
     This normal hook is run by `revert-buffer' before inserting the
     modified contents--but only if `revert-buffer-function' is `nil'.

 - Variable: after-revert-hook
     This normal hook is run by `revert-buffer' after inserting the
     modified contents--but only if `revert-buffer-function' is `nil'.

Buffers
*******

   A "buffer" is a Lisp object containing text to be edited.  Buffers
are used to hold the contents of files that are being visited; there may
also be buffers that are not visiting files.  While several buffers may
exist at one time, only one buffer is designated the "current buffer"
at any time.  Most editing commands act on the contents of the current
buffer.  Each buffer, including the current buffer, may or may not be
displayed in any windows.

Buffer Basics
=============

   A "buffer" is a Lisp object containing text to be edited.  Buffers
are used to hold the contents of files that are being visited; there may
also be buffers that are not visiting files.  Although several buffers
normally exist, only one buffer is designated the "current buffer" at
any time.  Most editing commands act on the contents of the current
buffer.  Each buffer, including the current buffer, may or may not be
displayed in any windows.

   Buffers in Emacs editing are objects that have distinct names and
hold text that can be edited.  Buffers appear to Lisp programs as a
special data type.  You can think of the contents of a buffer as a
string that you can extend; insertions and deletions may occur in any
part of the buffer.  *Note Text::.

   A Lisp buffer object contains numerous pieces of information.  Some
of this information is directly accessible to the programmer through
variables, while other information is accessible only through
special-purpose functions.  For example, the visited file name is
directly accessible through a variable, while the value of point is
accessible only through a primitive function.

   Buffer-specific information that is directly accessible is stored in
"buffer-local" variable bindings, which are variable values that are
effective only in a particular buffer.  This feature allows each buffer
to override the values of certain variables.  Most major modes override
variables such as `fill-column' or `comment-column' in this way.  For
more information about buffer-local variables and functions related to
them, see *Note Buffer-Local Variables::.

   For functions and variables related to visiting files in buffers, see
*Note Visiting Files:: and *Note Saving Buffers::.  For functions and
variables related to the display of buffers in windows, see *Note
Buffers and Windows::.

 - Function: bufferp object
     This function returns `t' if OBJECT is a buffer, `nil' otherwise.

The Current Buffer
==================

   There are, in general, many buffers in an Emacs session.  At any
time, one of them is designated as the "current buffer".  This is the
buffer in which most editing takes place, because most of the primitives
for examining or changing text in a buffer operate implicitly on the
current buffer (*note Text::).  Normally the buffer that is displayed on
the screen in the selected window is the current buffer, but this is not
always so: a Lisp program can temporarily designate any buffer as
current in order to operate on its contents, without changing what is
displayed on the screen.

   The way to designate a current buffer in a Lisp program is by calling
`set-buffer'.  The specified buffer remains current until a new one is
designated.

   When an editing command returns to the editor command loop, the
command loop designates the buffer displayed in the selected window as
current, to prevent confusion: the buffer that the cursor is in when
Emacs reads a command is the buffer that the command will apply to.
(*Note Command Loop::.)  Therefore, `set-buffer' is not the way to
switch visibly to a different buffer so that the user can edit it.  For
that, you must use the functions described in *Note Displaying
Buffers::.

   *Note:* Lisp functions that change to a different current buffer
should not depend on the command loop to set it back afterwards.
Editing commands written in Emacs Lisp can be called from other programs
as well as from the command loop; it is convenient for the caller if
the subroutine does not change which buffer is current (unless, of
course, that is the subroutine's purpose).  Therefore, you should
normally use `set-buffer' within a `save-current-buffer' or
`save-excursion' (*note Excursions::) form that will restore the
current buffer when your function is done.  Here is an example, the
code for the command `append-to-buffer' (with the documentation string
abridged):

     (defun append-to-buffer (buffer start end)
       "Append to specified buffer the text of the region.
     ..."
       (interactive "BAppend to buffer: \nr")
       (let ((oldbuf (current-buffer)))
         (save-current-buffer
           (set-buffer (get-buffer-create buffer))
           (insert-buffer-substring oldbuf start end))))

This function binds a local variable to record the current buffer, and
then `save-current-buffer' arranges to make it current again.  Next,
`set-buffer' makes the specified buffer current.  Finally,
`insert-buffer-substring' copies the string from the original current
buffer to the specified (and now current) buffer.

   If the buffer appended to happens to be displayed in some window,
the next redisplay will show how its text has changed.  Otherwise, you
will not see the change immediately on the screen.  The buffer becomes
current temporarily during the execution of the command, but this does
not cause it to be displayed.

   If you make local bindings (with `let' or function arguments) for a
variable that may also have buffer-local bindings, make sure that the
same buffer is current at the beginning and at the end of the local
binding's scope.  Otherwise you might bind it in one buffer and unbind
it in another!  There are two ways to do this.  In simple cases, you may
see that nothing ever changes the current buffer within the scope of the
binding.  Otherwise, use `save-current-buffer' or `save-excursion' to
make sure that the buffer current at the beginning is current again
whenever the variable is unbound.

   Do not rely on using `set-buffer' to change the current buffer back,
because that won't do the job if a quit happens while the wrong buffer
is current.  Here is what _not_ to do:

     (let (buffer-read-only
           (obuf (current-buffer)))
       (set-buffer ...)
       ...
       (set-buffer obuf))

Using `save-current-buffer', as shown here, handles quitting, errors,
and `throw', as well as ordinary evaluation.

     (let (buffer-read-only)
       (save-current-buffer
         (set-buffer ...)
         ...))

 - Function: current-buffer
     This function returns the current buffer.

          (current-buffer)
               => #<buffer buffers.texi>

 - Function: set-buffer buffer-or-name
     This function makes BUFFER-OR-NAME the current buffer.  This does
     not display the buffer in any window, so the user cannot
     necessarily see the buffer.  But Lisp programs will now operate on
     it.

     This function returns the buffer identified by BUFFER-OR-NAME.  An
     error is signaled if BUFFER-OR-NAME does not identify an existing
     buffer.

 - Special Form: save-current-buffer body...
     The `save-current-buffer' macro saves the identity of the current
     buffer, evaluates the BODY forms, and finally restores that buffer
     as current.  The return value is the value of the last form in
     BODY.  The current buffer is restored even in case of an abnormal
     exit via `throw' or error (*note Nonlocal Exits::).

     If the buffer that used to be current has been killed by the time
     of exit from `save-current-buffer', then it is not made current
     again, of course.  Instead, whichever buffer was current just
     before exit remains current.

 - Macro: with-current-buffer buffer body...
     The `with-current-buffer' macro saves the identity of the current
     buffer, makes BUFFER current, evaluates the BODY forms, and
     finally restores the buffer.  The return value is the value of the
     last form in BODY.  The current buffer is restored even in case of
     an abnormal exit via `throw' or error (*note Nonlocal Exits::).

 - Macro: with-temp-buffer body...
     The `with-temp-buffer' macro evaluates the BODY forms with a
     temporary buffer as the current buffer.  It saves the identity of
     the current buffer, creates a temporary buffer and makes it
     current, evaluates the BODY forms, and finally restores the
     previous current buffer while killing the temporary buffer.

     The return value is the value of the last form in BODY.  You can
     return the contents of the temporary buffer by using
     `(buffer-string)' as the last form.

     The current buffer is restored even in case of an abnormal exit via
     `throw' or error (*note Nonlocal Exits::).

   See also `with-temp-file' in *Note Writing to Files::.

Buffer Names
============

   Each buffer has a unique name, which is a string.  Many of the
functions that work on buffers accept either a buffer or a buffer name
as an argument.  Any argument called BUFFER-OR-NAME is of this sort,
and an error is signaled if it is neither a string nor a buffer.  Any
argument called BUFFER must be an actual buffer object, not a name.

   Buffers that are ephemeral and generally uninteresting to the user
have names starting with a space, so that the `list-buffers' and
`buffer-menu' commands don't mention them.  A name starting with space
also initially disables recording undo information; see *Note Undo::.

 - Function: buffer-name &optional buffer
     This function returns the name of BUFFER as a string.  If BUFFER
     is not supplied, it defaults to the current buffer.

     If `buffer-name' returns `nil', it means that BUFFER has been
     killed.  *Note Killing Buffers::.

          (buffer-name)
               => "buffers.texi"
          
          (setq foo (get-buffer "temp"))
               => #<buffer temp>
          (kill-buffer foo)
               => nil
          (buffer-name foo)
               => nil
          foo
               => #<killed buffer>

 - Command: rename-buffer newname &optional unique
     This function renames the current buffer to NEWNAME.  An error is
     signaled if NEWNAME is not a string, or if there is already a
     buffer with that name.  The function returns NEWNAME.

     Ordinarily, `rename-buffer' signals an error if NEWNAME is already
     in use.  However, if UNIQUE is non-`nil', it modifies NEWNAME to
     make a name that is not in use.  Interactively, you can make
     UNIQUE non-`nil' with a numeric prefix argument.  (This is how the
     command `rename-uniquely' is implemented.)

 - Function: get-buffer buffer-or-name
     This function returns the buffer specified by BUFFER-OR-NAME.  If
     BUFFER-OR-NAME is a string and there is no buffer with that name,
     the value is `nil'.  If BUFFER-OR-NAME is a buffer, it is returned
     as given; that is not very useful, so the argument is usually a
     name.  For example:

          (setq b (get-buffer "lewis"))
               => #<buffer lewis>
          (get-buffer b)
               => #<buffer lewis>
          (get-buffer "Frazzle-nots")
               => nil

     See also the function `get-buffer-create' in *Note Creating
     Buffers::.

 - Function: generate-new-buffer-name starting-name &rest ignore
     This function returns a name that would be unique for a new
     buffer--but does not create the buffer.  It starts with
     STARTING-NAME, and produces a name not currently in use for any
     buffer by appending a number inside of `<...>'.

     If the optional second argument IGNORE is non-`nil', it should be
     a string; it makes a difference if it is a name in the sequence of
     names to be tried.  That name will be considered acceptable, if it
     is tried, even if a buffer with that name exists.  Thus, if
     buffers named `foo', `foo<2>', `foo<3>' and `foo<4>' exist,

          (generate-new-buffer-name "foo")
               => "foo<5>"
          (generate-new-buffer-name "foo" "foo<3>")
               => "foo<3>"
          (generate-new-buffer-name "foo" "foo<6>")
               => "foo<5>"

     See the related function `generate-new-buffer' in *Note Creating
     Buffers::.
