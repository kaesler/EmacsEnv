Defining Custom Groups
======================

   Each Emacs Lisp package should have one main customization group
which contains all the options, faces and other groups in the package.
If the package has a small number of options and faces, use just one
group and put everything in it.  When there are more than twelve or so
options and faces, then you should structure them into subgroups, and
put the subgroups under the package's main customization group.  It is
OK to put some of the options and faces in the package's main group
alongside the subgroups.

   The package's main or only group should be a member of one or more of
the standard customization groups.  (To display the full list of them,
use `M-x customize'.)  Choose one or more of them (but not too many),
and add your group to each of them using the `:group' keyword.

   The way to declare new customization groups is with `defgroup'.

 - Macro: defgroup group members doc [keyword value]...
     Declare GROUP as a customization group containing MEMBERS.  Do not
     quote the symbol GROUP.  The argument DOC specifies the
     documentation string for the group.  It should not start with a
     `*' as in `defcustom'; that convention is for variables only.

     The argument MEMBERS is a list specifying an initial set of
     customization items to be members of the group.  However, most
     often MEMBERS is `nil', and you specify the group's members by
     using the `:group' keyword when defining those members.

     If you want to specify group members through MEMBERS, each element
     should have the form `(NAME WIDGET)'.  Here NAME is a symbol, and
     WIDGET is a widget type for editing that symbol.  Useful widgets
     are `custom-variable' for a variable, `custom-face' for a face,
     and `custom-group' for a group.

     When a new group is introduced into Emacs, use this keyword in
     `defgroup':

    `:version VERSION'
          This option specifies that the group was first introduced in
          Emacs version VERSION.  The value VERSION must be a string.

     Tag the group with a version like this when it is introduced,
     rather than the individual members (*note Variable Definitions::).

     In addition to the common keywords (*note Common Keywords::), you
     can also use this keyword in `defgroup':

    `:prefix PREFIX'
          If the name of an item in the group starts with PREFIX, then
          the tag for that item is constructed (by default) by omitting
          PREFIX.

          One group can have any number of prefixes.

   The prefix-discarding feature is currently turned off, which means
that `:prefix' currently has no effect.  We did this because we found
that discarding the specified prefixes often led to confusing names for
options.  This happened because the people who wrote the `defgroup'
definitions for various groups added `:prefix' keywords whenever they
make logical sense--that is, whenever the variables in the library have
a common prefix.

   In order to obtain good results with `:prefix', it would be
necessary to check the specific effects of discarding a particular
prefix, given the specific items in a group and their names and
documentation.  If the resulting text is not clear, then `:prefix'
should not be used in that case.

   It should be possible to recheck all the customization groups, delete
the `:prefix' specifications which give unclear results, and then turn
this feature back on, if someone would like to do the work.

Defining Customization Variables
================================

   Use `defcustom' to declare user-editable variables.

 - Macro: defcustom option default doc [keyword value]...
     Declare OPTION as a customizable user option variable.  Do not
     quote OPTION.  The argument DOC specifies the documentation string
     for the variable.  It should often start with a `*' to mark it as
     a "user option" (*note Defining Variables::).  Do not start the
     documentation string with `*' for options which cannot or normally
     should not be set with `set-variable'; examples of the former are
     global minor mode options such as `global-font-lock-mode' and
     examples of the latter are hooks.

     If OPTION is void, `defcustom' initializes it to DEFAULT.  DEFAULT
     should be an expression to compute the value; be careful in
     writing it, because it can be evaluated on more than one occasion.
     You should normally avoid using backquotes in DEFAULT because
     they are not expanded when editing the value, causing list values
     to appear to have the wrong structure.

     When you evaluate a `defcustom' form with `C-M-x' in Emacs Lisp
     mode (`eval-defun'), a special feature of `eval-defun' arranges to
     set the variable unconditionally, without testing whether its
     value is void.  (The same feature applies to `defvar'.)  *Note
     Defining Variables::.

   `defcustom' accepts the following additional keywords:

`:type TYPE'
     Use TYPE as the data type for this option.  It specifies which
     values are legitimate, and how to display the value.  *Note
     Customization Types::, for more information.

`:options LIST'
     Specify LIST as the list of reasonable values for use in this
     option.  The user is not restricted to using only these values,
     but they are offered as convenient alternatives.

     This is meaningful only for certain types, currently including
     `hook', `plist' and `alist'.  See the definition of the individual
     types for a description of how to use `:options'.

`:version VERSION'
     This option specifies that the variable was first introduced, or
     its default value was changed, in Emacs version VERSION.  The value
     VERSION must be a string.  For example,

          (defcustom foo-max 34
            "*Maximum number of foo's allowed."
            :type 'integer
            :group 'foo
            :version "20.3")

`:set SETFUNCTION'
     Specify SETFUNCTION as the way to change the value of this option.
     The function SETFUNCTION should take two arguments, a symbol and
     the new value, and should do whatever is necessary to update the
     value properly for this option (which may not mean simply setting
     the option as a Lisp variable).  The default for SETFUNCTION is
     `set-default'.

`:get GETFUNCTION'
     Specify GETFUNCTION as the way to extract the value of this
     option.  The function GETFUNCTION should take one argument, a
     symbol, and should return the "current value" for that symbol
     (which need not be the symbol's Lisp value).  The default is
     `default-value'.

`:initialize FUNCTION'
     FUNCTION should be a function used to initialize the variable when
     the `defcustom' is evaluated.  It should take two arguments, the
     symbol and value.  Here are some predefined functions meant for
     use in this way:

    `custom-initialize-set'
          Use the variable's `:set' function to initialize the
          variable, but do not reinitialize it if it is already
          non-void.  This is the default `:initialize' function.

    `custom-initialize-default'
          Like `custom-initialize-set', but use the function
          `set-default' to set the variable, instead of the variable's
          `:set' function.  This is the usual choice for a variable
          whose `:set' function enables or disables a minor mode; with
          this choice, defining the variable will not call the minor
          mode function, but customizing the variable will do so.

    `custom-initialize-reset'
          Always use the `:set' function to initialize the variable.
          If the variable is already non-void, reset it by calling the
          `:set' function using the current value (returned by the
          `:get' method).

    `custom-initialize-changed'
          Use the `:set' function to initialize the variable, if it is
          already set or has been customized; otherwise, just use
          `set-default'.

`:set-after VARIABLES'
     When setting variables according to saved customizations, make
     sure to set the variables VARIABLES before this one; in other
     words, delay setting this variable until after those others have
     been handled.  Use `:set-after' if setting this variable won't
     work properly unless those other variables already have their
     intended values.

   The `:require' option is useful for an option that turns on the
operation of a certain feature.  Assuming that the package is coded to
check the value of the option, you still need to arrange for the package
to be loaded.  You can do that with `:require'.  *Note Common
Keywords::.  Here is an example, from the library `paren.el':

     (defcustom show-paren-mode nil
       "Toggle Show Paren mode..."
       :set (lambda (symbol value)
              (show-paren-mode (or value 0)))
       :initialize 'custom-initialize-default
       :type 'boolean
       :group 'paren-showing
       :require 'paren)

   If a customization item has a type such as `hook' or `alist', which
supports `:options', you can add additional options to the item,
outside the `defcustom' declaration, by calling `custom-add-option'.
For example, if you define a function `my-lisp-mode-initialization'
intended to be called from `emacs-lisp-mode-hook', you might want to
add that to the list of options for `emacs-lisp-mode-hook', but not by
editing its definition.   You can do it thus:

     (custom-add-option 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
                        'my-lisp-mode-initialization)

 - Function: custom-add-option symbol option
     To the customization SYMBOL, add OPTION.

     The precise effect of adding OPTION depends on the customization
     type of SYMBOL.

   Internally, `defcustom' uses the symbol property `standard-value' to
record the expression for the default value, and `saved-value' to
record the value saved by the user with the customization buffer.  The
`saved-value' property is actually a list whose car is an expression
which evaluates to the value.

Customization Types
===================

   When you define a user option with `defcustom', you must specify its
"customization type".  That is a Lisp object which describes (1) which
values are legitimate and (2) how to display the value in the
customization buffer for editing.

   You specify the customization type in `defcustom' with the `:type'
keyword.  The argument of `:type' is evaluated; since types that vary
at run time are rarely useful, normally you use a quoted constant.  For
example:

     (defcustom diff-command "diff"
       "*The command to use to run diff."
       :type '(string)
       :group 'diff)

   In general, a customization type is a list whose first element is a
symbol, one of the customization type names defined in the following
sections.  After this symbol come a number of arguments, depending on
the symbol.  Between the type symbol and its arguments, you can
optionally write keyword-value pairs (*note Type Keywords::).

   Some of the type symbols do not use any arguments; those are called
"simple types".  For a simple type, if you do not use any keyword-value
pairs, you can omit the parentheses around the type symbol.  For
example just `string' as a customization type is equivalent to
`(string)'.

File: elisp,  Node: Simple Types,  Next: Composite Types,  Up: Customization Types

Simple Types
------------

   This section describes all the simple customization types.

`sexp'
     The value may be any Lisp object that can be printed and read
     back.  You can use `sexp' as a fall-back for any option, if you
     don't want to take the time to work out a more specific type to
     use.

`integer'
     The value must be an integer, and is represented textually in the
     customization buffer.

`number'
     The value must be a number, and is represented textually in the
     customization buffer.

`string'
     The value must be a string, and the customization buffer shows
     just the contents, with no delimiting `"' characters and no
     quoting with `\'.

`regexp'
     Like `string' except that the string must be a valid regular
     expression.

`character'
     The value must be a character code.  A character code is actually
     an integer, but this type shows the value by inserting the
     character in the buffer, rather than by showing the number.

`file'
     The value must be a file name, and you can do completion with
     `M-<TAB>'.

`(file :must-match t)'
     The value must be a file name for an existing file, and you can do
     completion with `M-<TAB>'.

`directory'
     The value must be a directory name, and you can do completion with
     `M-<TAB>'.

`hook'
     The value must be a list of functions (or a single function, but
     that is obsolete usage).  This customization type is used for hook
     variables.  You can use the `:options' keyword in a hook variable's
     `defcustom' to specify a list of functions recommended for use in
     the hook; see *Note Variable Definitions::.

`alist'
     The value must be a list of cons-cells, the CAR of each cell
     representing a key, and the CDR of the same cell representing an
     associated value.  The user can add and delete key/value pairs, and
     edit both the key and the value of each pair.

     You can specify the key and value types like this:

          (alist :key-type KEY-TYPE :value-type VALUE-TYPE)

     where KEY-TYPE and VALUE-TYPE are customization type
     specifications.  The default key type is `sexp', and the default
     value type is `sexp'.

     The user can add any key matching the specified key type, but you
     can give some keys a preferential treatment by specifying them
     with the `:options' (see *Note Variable Definitions::).  The
     specified keys will always be shown in the customize buffer
     (together with a suitable value), with a checkbox to include or
     exclude or disable the key/value pair from the alist.  The user
     will not be able to edit the keys specified by the `:options'
     keyword argument.

     The argument to the `:options' keywords should be a list of option
     specifications.  Ordinarily, the options are simply atoms, which
     are the specified keys.  For example:

          :options '("foo" "bar" "baz")

     specifies that there are three "known" keys, namely `"foo"',
     `"bar"' and `"baz"', which will always be shown first.

     You may want to restrict the value type for specific keys, for
     example, the value associated with the `"bar"' key can only be an
     integer.  You can specify this by using a list instead of an atom
     in the option specification.  The first element will specify the
     key, like before, while the second element will specify the value
     type.

          :options '("foo" ("bar" integer) "baz")

     Finally, you may want to change how the key is presented.  By
     default, the key is simply shown as a `const', since the user
     cannot change the special keys specified with the `:options'
     keyword.  However, you may want to use a more specialized type for
     presenting the key, like `function-item' if you know it is a
     symbol with a function binding.  This is done by using a
     customization type specification instead of a symbol for the key.

          :options '("foo" ((function-item some-function) integer) "baz")

     Many alists use lists with two elements, instead of cons cells.
     For example,

          (defcustom list-alist '(("foo" 1) ("bar" 2) ("baz" 3))
            "Each element is a list of the form (KEY VALUE).")

     instead of

          (defcustom cons-alist '(("foo" . 1) ("bar" . 2) ("baz" . 3))
            "Each element is a cons-cell (KEY . VALUE).")

     Because of the way lists are implemented on top of cons cells, you
     can treat `list-alist' in the example above as a cons cell alist,
     where the value type is a list with a single element containing
     the real value.

          (defcustom list-alist '(("foo" 1) ("bar" 2) ("baz" 3))
            "Each element is a list of the form (KEY VALUE)."
            :type '(alist :value-type (group integer)))

     The `group' widget is used here instead of `list' only because the
     formatting is better suited for the purpose.

     Similarily, you can have alists with more values associated with
     each key, using variations of this trick:

          (defcustom person-data '(("brian"  50 t)
                                   ("dorith" 55 nil)
                                   ("ken"    52 t))
            "Alist of basic info about people.
          Each element has the form (NAME AGE MALE-FLAG)."
            :type '(alist :value-type (group age boolean)))
          
          (defcustom pets '(("brian")
                            ("dorith" "dog" "guppy")
                            ("ken" "cat"))
            "Alist of people's pets.
          In an element (KEY . VALUE), KEY is the person's name,
          and the VALUE is a list of that person's pets."
            :type '(alist :value-type (repeat string)))

`plist'
     The `plist' custom type is similar to the `alist' (see above),
     except that the information is stored as a property list, i.e. a
     list of this form:

          (KEY VALUE KEY VALUE KEY VALUE ...)

     The default `:key-type' for `plist' is `symbol', rather than
     `sexp'.

`symbol'
     The value must be a symbol.  It appears in the customization
     buffer as the name of the symbol.

`function'
     The value must be either a lambda expression or a function name.
     When it is a function name, you can do completion with `M-<TAB>'.

`variable'
     The value must be a variable name, and you can do completion with
     `M-<TAB>'.

`face'
     The value must be a symbol which is a face name, and you can do
     completion with `M-<TAB>'.

`boolean'
     The value is boolean--either `nil' or `t'.  Note that by using
     `choice' and `const' together (see the next section), you can
     specify that the value must be `nil' or `t', but also specify the
     text to describe each value in a way that fits the specific
     meaning of the alternative.

`coding-system'
     The value must be a coding-system name, and you can do completion
     with `M-<TAB>'.

`color'
     The value must be a valid color name, and you can do completion
     with `M-<TAB>'.  A sample is provided,


File: elisp,  Node: Composite Types,  Next: Splicing into Lists,  Prev: Simple Types,  Up: Customization Types

Composite Types
---------------

   When none of the simple types is appropriate, you can use composite
types, which build new types from other types.  Here are several ways of
doing that:

`(restricted-sexp :match-alternatives CRITERIA)'
     The value may be any Lisp object that satisfies one of CRITERIA.
     CRITERIA should be a list, and each element should be one of these
     possibilities:

        * A predicate--that is, a function of one argument that has no
          side effects, and returns either `nil' or non-`nil' according
          to the argument.  Using a predicate in the list says that
          objects for which the predicate returns non-`nil' are
          acceptable.

        * A quoted constant--that is, `'OBJECT'.  This sort of element
          in the list says that OBJECT itself is an acceptable value.

     For example,

          (restricted-sexp :match-alternatives
                           (integerp 't 'nil))

     allows integers, `t' and `nil' as legitimate values.

     The customization buffer shows all legitimate values using their
     read syntax, and the user edits them textually.

`(cons CAR-TYPE CDR-TYPE)'
     The value must be a cons cell, its CAR must fit CAR-TYPE, and its
     CDR must fit CDR-TYPE.  For example, `(cons string symbol)' is a
     customization type which matches values such as `("foo" . foo)'.

     In the customization buffer, the CAR and the CDR are displayed and
     edited separately, each according to the type that you specify for
     it.

`(list ELEMENT-TYPES...)'
     The value must be a list with exactly as many elements as the
     ELEMENT-TYPES you have specified; and each element must fit the
     corresponding ELEMENT-TYPE.

     For example, `(list integer string function)' describes a list of
     three elements; the first element must be an integer, the second a
     string, and the third a function.

     In the customization buffer, each element is displayed and edited
     separately, according to the type specified for it.

`(vector ELEMENT-TYPES...)'
     Like `list' except that the value must be a vector instead of a
     list.  The elements work the same as in `list'.

`(choice ALTERNATIVE-TYPES...)'
     The value must fit at least one of ALTERNATIVE-TYPES.  For
     example, `(choice integer string)' allows either an integer or a
     string.

     In the customization buffer, the user selects one of the
     alternatives using a menu, and can then edit the value in the
     usual way for that alternative.

     Normally the strings in this menu are determined automatically
     from the choices; however, you can specify different strings for
     the menu by including the `:tag' keyword in the alternatives.  For
     example, if an integer stands for a number of spaces, while a
     string is text to use verbatim, you might write the customization
     type this way,

          (choice (integer :tag "Number of spaces")
                  (string :tag "Literal text"))

     so that the menu offers `Number of spaces' and `Literal Text'.

     In any alternative for which `nil' is not a valid value, other than
     a `const', you should specify a valid default for that alternative
     using the `:value' keyword.  *Note Type Keywords::.

`(radio ELEMENT-TYPES...)'
     This is similar to `choice', except that the choices are displayed
     using `radio buttons' rather than a menu.  This has the advantage
     of displaying documentation for the choices when applicable and so
     is often a good choice for a choice between constant functions
     (`function-item' customization types).

`(const VALUE)'
     The value must be VALUE--nothing else is allowed.

     The main use of `const' is inside of `choice'.  For example,
     `(choice integer (const nil))' allows either an integer or `nil'.

     `:tag' is often used with `const', inside of `choice'.  For
     example,

          (choice (const :tag "Yes" t)
                  (const :tag "No" nil)
                  (const :tag "Ask" foo))

     describes a variable for which `t' means yes, `nil' means no, and
     `foo' means "ask."

`(other VALUE)'
     This alternative can match any Lisp value, but if the user chooses
     this alternative, that selects the value VALUE.

     The main use of `other' is as the last element of `choice'.  For
     example,

          (choice (const :tag "Yes" t)
                  (const :tag "No" nil)
                  (other :tag "Ask" foo))

     describes a variable for which `t' means yes, `nil' means no, and
     anything else means "ask."  If the user chooses `Ask' from the
     menu of alternatives, that specifies the value `foo'; but any
     other value (not `t', `nil' or `foo') displays as `Ask', just like
     `foo'.

`(function-item FUNCTION)'
     Like `const', but used for values which are functions.  This
     displays the documentation string as well as the function name.
     The documentation string is either the one you specify with
     `:doc', or FUNCTION's own documentation string.

`(variable-item VARIABLE)'
     Like `const', but used for values which are variable names.  This
     displays the documentation string as well as the variable name.
     The documentation string is either the one you specify with
     `:doc', or VARIABLE's own documentation string.

`(set TYPES...)'
     The value must be a list, and each element of the list must match
     one of the TYPES specified.

     This appears in the customization buffer as a checklist, so that
     each of TYPES may have either one corresponding element or none.
     It is not possible to specify two different elements that match
     the same one of TYPES.  For example, `(set integer symbol)' allows
     one integer and/or one symbol in the list; it does not allow
     multiple integers or multiple symbols.  As a result, it is rare to
     use nonspecific types such as `integer' in a `set'.

     Most often, the TYPES in a `set' are `const' types, as shown here:

          (set (const :bold) (const :italic))

     Sometimes they describe possible elements in an alist:

          (set (cons :tag "Height" (const height) integer)
               (cons :tag "Width" (const width) integer))

     That lets the user specify a height value optionally and a width
     value optionally.

`(repeat ELEMENT-TYPE)'
     The value must be a list and each element of the list must fit the
     type ELEMENT-TYPE.  This appears in the customization buffer as a
     list of elements, with `[INS]' and `[DEL]' buttons for adding more
     elements or removing elements.

Splicing into Lists
-------------------

   The `:inline' feature lets you splice a variable number of elements
into the middle of a list or vector.  You use it in a `set', `choice'
or `repeat' type which appears among the element-types of a `list' or
`vector'.

   Normally, each of the element-types in a `list' or `vector'
describes one and only one element of the list or vector.  Thus, if an
element-type is a `repeat', that specifies a list of unspecified length
which appears as one element.

   But when the element-type uses `:inline', the value it matches is
merged directly into the containing sequence.  For example, if it
matches a list with three elements, those become three elements of the
overall sequence.  This is analogous to using `,@' in the backquote
construct.

   For example, to specify a list whose first element must be `t' and
whose remaining arguments should be zero or more of `foo' and `bar',
use this customization type:

     (list (const t) (set :inline t foo bar))

This matches values such as `(t)', `(t foo)', `(t bar)' and `(t foo
bar)'.

   When the element-type is a `choice', you use `:inline' not in the
`choice' itself, but in (some of) the alternatives of the `choice'.
For example, to match a list which must start with a file name,
followed either by the symbol `t' or two strings, use this
customization type:

     (list file
           (choice (const t)
                   (list :inline t string string)))

If the user chooses the first alternative in the choice, then the
overall list has two elements and the second element is `t'.  If the
user chooses the second alternative, then the overall list has three
elements and the second and third must be strings.


File: elisp,  Node: Type Keywords,  Prev: Splicing into Lists,  Up: Customization Types

Type Keywords
-------------

   You can specify keyword-argument pairs in a customization type after
the type name symbol.  Here are the keywords you can use, and their
meanings:

`:value DEFAULT'
     This is used for a type that appears as an alternative inside of
     `choice'; it specifies the default value to use, at first, if and
     when the user selects this alternative with the menu in the
     customization buffer.

     Of course, if the actual value of the option fits this
     alternative, it will appear showing the actual value, not DEFAULT.

     If `nil' is not a valid value for the alternative, then it is
     essential to specify a valid default with `:value'.

`:format FORMAT-STRING'
     This string will be inserted in the buffer to represent the value
     corresponding to the type.  The following `%' escapes are available
     for use in FORMAT-STRING:

    `%[BUTTON%]'
          Display the text BUTTON marked as a button.  The `:action'
          attribute specifies what the button will do if the user
          invokes it; its value is a function which takes two
          arguments--the widget which the button appears in, and the
          event.

          There is no way to specify two different buttons with
          different actions.

    `%{SAMPLE%}'
          Show SAMPLE in a special face specified by `:sample-face'.

    `%v'
          Substitute the item's value.  How the value is represented
          depends on the kind of item, and (for variables) on the
          customization type.

    `%d'
          Substitute the item's documentation string.

    `%h'
          Like `%d', but if the documentation string is more than one
          line, add an active field to control whether to show all of
          it or just the first line.

    `%t'
          Substitute the tag here.  You specify the tag with the `:tag'
          keyword.

    `%%'
          Display a literal `%'.

`:action ACTION'
     Perform ACTION if the user clicks on a button.

`:button-face FACE'
     Use the face FACE (a face name or a list of face names) for button
     text displayed with `%[...%]'.

`:button-prefix PREFIX'
`:button-suffix SUFFIX'
     These specify the text to display before and after a button.  Each
     can be:

    `nil'
          No text is inserted.

    a string
          The string is inserted literally.

    a symbol
          The symbol's value is used.

`:tag TAG'
     Use TAG (a string) as the tag for the value (or part of the value)
     that corresponds to this type.

`:doc DOC'
     Use DOC as the documentation string for this value (or part of the
     value) that corresponds to this type.  In order for this to work,
     you must specify a value for `:format', and use `%d' or `%h' in
     that value.

     The usual reason to specify a documentation string for a type is to
     provide more information about the meanings of alternatives inside
     a `:choice' type or the parts of some other composite type.

`:help-echo MOTION-DOC'
     When you move to this item with `widget-forward' or
     `widget-backward', it will display the string MOTION-DOC in the
     echo area.  In addition, MOTION-DOC is used as the mouse
     `help-echo' string and may actually be a function or form evaluated
     to yield a help string as for `help-echo' text properties.

`:match FUNCTION'
     Specify how to decide whether a value matches the type.  The
     corresponding value, FUNCTION, should be a function that accepts
     two arguments, a widget and a value; it should return non-`nil' if
     the value is acceptable.

Loading
*******

   Loading a file of Lisp code means bringing its contents into the Lisp
environment in the form of Lisp objects.  Emacs finds and opens the
file, reads the text, evaluates each form, and then closes the file.

   The load functions evaluate all the expressions in a file just as
the `eval-current-buffer' function evaluates all the expressions in a
buffer.  The difference is that the load functions read and evaluate
the text in the file as found on disk, not the text in an Emacs buffer.

   The loaded file must contain Lisp expressions, either as source code
or as byte-compiled code.  Each form in the file is called a "top-level
form".  There is no special format for the forms in a loadable file;
any form in a file may equally well be typed directly into a buffer and
evaluated there.  (Indeed, most code is tested this way.)  Most often,
the forms are function definitions and variable definitions.

   A file containing Lisp code is often called a "library".  Thus, the
"Rmail library" is a file containing code for Rmail mode.  Similarly, a
"Lisp library directory" is a directory of files containing Lisp code.

How Programs Do Loading
=======================

   Emacs Lisp has several interfaces for loading.  For example,
`autoload' creates a placeholder object for a function defined in a
file; trying to call the autoloading function loads the file to get the
function's real definition (*note Autoload::).  `require' loads a file
if it isn't already loaded (*note Named Features::).  Ultimately, all
these facilities call the `load' function to do the work.

 - Function: load filename &optional missing-ok nomessage nosuffix
          must-suffix
     This function finds and opens a file of Lisp code, evaluates all
     the forms in it, and closes the file.

     To find the file, `load' first looks for a file named
     `FILENAME.elc', that is, for a file whose name is FILENAME with
     `.elc' appended.  If such a file exists, it is loaded.  If there
     is no file by that name, then `load' looks for a file named
     `FILENAME.el'.  If that file exists, it is loaded.  Finally, if
     neither of those names is found, `load' looks for a file named
     FILENAME with nothing appended, and loads it if it exists.  (The
     `load' function is not clever about looking at FILENAME.  In the
     perverse case of a file named `foo.el.el', evaluation of `(load
     "foo.el")' will indeed find it.)

     If the optional argument NOSUFFIX is non-`nil', then the suffixes
     `.elc' and `.el' are not tried.  In this case, you must specify
     the precise file name you want.  By specifying the precise file
     name and using `t' for NOSUFFIX, you can prevent perverse file
     names such as `foo.el.el' from being tried.

     If the optional argument MUST-SUFFIX is non-`nil', then `load'
     insists that the file name used must end in either `.el' or
     `.elc', unless it contains an explicit directory name.  If
     FILENAME does not contain an explicit directory name, and does not
     end in a suffix, then `load' insists on adding one.

     If FILENAME is a relative file name, such as `foo' or
     `baz/foo.bar', `load' searches for the file using the variable
     `load-path'.  It appends FILENAME to each of the directories
     listed in `load-path', and loads the first file it finds whose name
     matches.  The current default directory is tried only if it is
     specified in `load-path', where `nil' stands for the default
     directory.  `load' tries all three possible suffixes in the first
     directory in `load-path', then all three suffixes in the second
     directory, and so on.  *Note Library Search::.

     If you get a warning that `foo.elc' is older than `foo.el', it
     means you should consider recompiling `foo.el'.  *Note Byte
     Compilation::.

     When loading a source file (not compiled), `load' performs
     character set translation just as Emacs would do when visiting the
     file.  *Note Coding Systems::.

     Messages like `Loading foo...' and `Loading foo...done' appear in
     the echo area during loading unless NOMESSAGE is non-`nil'.

     Any unhandled errors while loading a file terminate loading.  If
     the load was done for the sake of `autoload', any function
     definitions made during the loading are undone.

     If `load' can't find the file to load, then normally it signals the
     error `file-error' (with `Cannot open load file FILENAME').  But
     if MISSING-OK is non-`nil', then `load' just returns `nil'.

     You can use the variable `load-read-function' to specify a function
     for `load' to use instead of `read' for reading expressions.  See
     below.

     `load' returns `t' if the file loads successfully.

 - Command: load-file filename
     This command loads the file FILENAME.  If FILENAME is a relative
     file name, then the current default directory is assumed.
     `load-path' is not used, and suffixes are not appended.  Use this
     command if you wish to specify precisely the file name to load.

 - Command: load-library library
     This command loads the library named LIBRARY.  It is equivalent to
     `load', except in how it reads its argument interactively.

 - Variable: load-in-progress
     This variable is non-`nil' if Emacs is in the process of loading a
     file, and it is `nil' otherwise.

 - Variable: load-read-function
     This variable specifies an alternate expression-reading function
     for `load' and `eval-region' to use instead of `read'.  The
     function should accept one argument, just as `read' does.

     Normally, the variable's value is `nil', which means those
     functions should use `read'.

     *Note:* Instead of using this variable, it is cleaner to use
     another, newer feature: to pass the function as the READ-FUNCTION
     argument to `eval-region'.  *Note Eval::.

   For information about how `load' is used in building Emacs, see
*Note Building Emacs::.

Library Search
==============

   When Emacs loads a Lisp library, it searches for the library in a
list of directories specified by the variable `load-path'.

 - User Option: load-path
     The value of this variable is a list of directories to search when
     loading files with `load'.  Each element is a string (which must be
     a directory name) or `nil' (which stands for the current working
     directory).

   The value of `load-path' is initialized from the environment
variable `EMACSLOADPATH', if that exists; otherwise its default value
is specified in `emacs/src/paths.h' when Emacs is built.  Then the list
is expanded by adding subdirectories of the directories in the list.

   The syntax of `EMACSLOADPATH' is the same as used for `PATH'; `:'
(or `;', according to the operating system) separates directory names,
and `.' is used for the current default directory.  Here is an example
of how to set your `EMACSLOADPATH' variable from a `csh' `.login' file:

     setenv EMACSLOADPATH .:/user/bil/emacs:/usr/local/share/emacs/20.3/lisp

   Here is how to set it using `sh':

     export EMACSLOADPATH
     EMACSLOADPATH=.:/user/bil/emacs:/usr/local/share/emacs/20.3/lisp

   Here is an example of code you can place in your init file (*note
Init File::) to add several directories to the front of your default
`load-path':

     (setq load-path
           (append (list nil "/user/bil/emacs"
                         "/usr/local/lisplib"
                         "~/emacs")
                   load-path))

In this example, the path searches the current working directory first,
followed then by the `/user/bil/emacs' directory, the
`/usr/local/lisplib' directory, and the `~/emacs' directory, which are
then followed by the standard directories for Lisp code.

   Dumping Emacs uses a special value of `load-path'.  If the value of
`load-path' at the end of dumping is unchanged (that is, still the same
special value), the dumped Emacs switches to the ordinary `load-path'
value when it starts up, as described above.  But if `load-path' has
any other value at the end of dumping, that value is used for execution
of the dumped Emacs also.

   Therefore, if you want to change `load-path' temporarily for loading
a few libraries in `site-init.el' or `site-load.el', you should bind
`load-path' locally with `let' around the calls to `load'.

   The default value of `load-path', when running an Emacs which has
been installed on the system, includes two special directories (and
their subdirectories as well):

     "/usr/local/share/emacs/VERSION/site-lisp"

and

     "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp"

The first one is for locally installed packages for a particular Emacs
version; the second is for locally installed packages meant for use with
all installed Emacs versions.

   There are several reasons why a Lisp package that works well in one
Emacs version can cause trouble in another.  Sometimes packages need
updating for incompatible changes in Emacs; sometimes they depend on
undocumented internal Emacs data that can change without notice;
sometimes a newer Emacs version incorporates a version of the package,
and should be used only with that version.

   Emacs finds these directories' subdirectories and adds them to
`load-path' when it starts up.  Both immediate subdirectories and
subdirectories multiple levels down are added to `load-path'.

   Not all subdirectories are included, though.  Subdirectories whose
names do not start with a letter or digit are excluded.  Subdirectories
named `RCS' or `CVS' are excluded.  Also, a subdirectory which contains
a file named `.nosearch' is excluded.  You can use these methods to
prevent certain subdirectories of the `site-lisp' directories from
being searched.

   If you run Emacs from the directory where it was built--that is, an
executable that has not been formally installed--then `load-path'
normally contains two additional directories.  These are the `lisp' and
`site-lisp' subdirectories of the main build directory.  (Both are
represented as absolute file names.)

 - Command: locate-library library &optional nosuffix path
          interactive-call
     This command finds the precise file name for library LIBRARY.  It
     searches for the library in the same way `load' does, and the
     argument NOSUFFIX has the same meaning as in `load': don't add
     suffixes `.elc' or `.el' to the specified name LIBRARY.

     If the PATH is non-`nil', that list of directories is used instead
     of `load-path'.

     When `locate-library' is called from a program, it returns the file
     name as a string.  When the user runs `locate-library'
     interactively, the argument INTERACTIVE-CALL is `t', and this
     tells `locate-library' to display the file name in the echo area.

Loading Non-ASCII Characters
============================

   When Emacs Lisp programs contain string constants with non-ASCII
characters, these can be represented within Emacs either as unibyte
strings or as multibyte strings (*note Text Representations::).  Which
representation is used depends on how the file is read into Emacs.  If
it is read with decoding into multibyte representation, the text of the
Lisp program will be multibyte text, and its string constants will be
multibyte strings.  If a file containing Latin-1 characters (for
example) is read without decoding, the text of the program will be
unibyte text, and its string constants will be unibyte strings.  *Note
Coding Systems::.

   To make the results more predictable, Emacs always performs decoding
into the multibyte representation when loading Lisp files, even if it
was started with the `--unibyte' option.  This means that string
constants with non-ASCII characters translate into multibyte strings.
The only exception is when a particular file specifies no decoding.

   The reason Emacs is designed this way is so that Lisp programs give
predictable results, regardless of how Emacs was started.  In addition,
this enables programs that depend on using multibyte text to work even
in a unibyte Emacs.  Of course, such programs should be designed to
notice whether the user prefers unibyte or multibyte text, by checking
`default-enable-multibyte-characters', and convert representations
appropriately.

   In most Emacs Lisp programs, the fact that non-ASCII strings are
multibyte strings should not be noticeable, since inserting them in
unibyte buffers converts them to unibyte automatically.  However, if
this does make a difference, you can force a particular Lisp file to be
interpreted as unibyte by writing `-*-unibyte: t;-*-' in a comment on
the file's first line.  With that designator, the file will
unconditionally be interpreted as unibyte, even in an ordinary
multibyte Emacs session.  This can matter when making keybindings to
non-ASCII characters written as `?vLITERAL'.
