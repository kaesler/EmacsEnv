Coordinates and Windows
=======================

   This section describes how to relate screen coordinates to windows.

 - Function: window-at x y &optional frame
     This function returns the window containing the specified cursor
     position in the frame FRAME.  The coordinates X and Y are measured
     in characters and count from the top left corner of the frame.  If
     they are out of range, `window-at' returns `nil'.

     If you omit FRAME, the selected frame is used.

 - Function: coordinates-in-window-p coordinates window
     This function checks whether a particular frame position falls
     within the window WINDOW.

     The argument COORDINATES is a cons cell of the form `(X . Y)'.
     The coordinates X and Y are measured in characters, and count from
     the top left corner of the screen or frame.

     The value returned by `coordinates-in-window-p' is non-`nil' if
     the coordinates are inside WINDOW.  The value also indicates what
     part of the window the position is in, as follows:

    `(RELX . RELY)'
          The coordinates are inside WINDOW.  The numbers RELX and RELY
          are the equivalent window-relative coordinates for the
          specified position, counting from 0 at the top left corner of
          the window.

    `mode-line'
          The coordinates are in the mode line of WINDOW.

    `header-line'
          The coordinates are in the header line of WINDOW.

    `vertical-line'
          The coordinates are in the vertical line between WINDOW and
          its neighbor to the right.  This value occurs only if the
          window doesn't have a scroll bar; positions in a scroll bar
          are considered outside the window for these purposes.

    `nil'
          The coordinates are not in any part of WINDOW.

     The function `coordinates-in-window-p' does not require a frame as
     argument because it always uses the frame that WINDOW is on.

Window Configurations
=====================

   A "window configuration" records the entire layout of one frame--all
windows, their sizes, which buffers they contain, what part of each
buffer is displayed, and the values of point and the mark.  You can
bring back an entire previous layout by restoring a window
configuration previously saved.

   If you want to record all frames instead of just one, use a frame
configuration instead of a window configuration.  *Note Frame
Configurations::.

 - Function: current-window-configuration &optional frame
     This function returns a new object representing FRAME's current
     window configuration, including the number of windows, their sizes
     and current buffers, which window is the selected window, and for
     each window the displayed buffer, the display-start position, and
     the positions of point and the mark.  It also includes the values
     of `window-min-height', `window-min-width' and
     `minibuffer-scroll-window'.  An exception is made for point in the
     current buffer, whose value is not saved.

     If FRAME is omitted, the selected frame is used.

 - Function: set-window-configuration configuration
     This function restores the configuration of windows and buffers as
     specified by CONFIGURATION, for the frame that CONFIGURATION was
     created for.

     The argument CONFIGURATION must be a value that was previously
     returned by `current-window-configuration'.  This configuration is
     restored in the frame from which CONFIGURATION was made, whether
     that frame is selected or not.  This always counts as a window size
     change and triggers execution of the `window-size-change-functions'
     (*note Window Hooks::), because `set-window-configuration' doesn't
     know how to tell whether the new configuration actually differs
     from the old one.

     If the frame which CONFIGURATION was saved from is dead, all this
     function does is restore the three variables `window-min-height',
     `window-min-width' and `minibuffer-scroll-window'.

     Here is a way of using this function to get the same effect as
     `save-window-excursion':

          (let ((config (current-window-configuration)))
            (unwind-protect
                (progn (split-window-vertically nil)
                       ...)
              (set-window-configuration config)))

 - Special Form: save-window-excursion forms...
     This special form records the window configuration, executes FORMS
     in sequence, then restores the earlier window configuration.  The
     window configuration includes the value of point and the portion
     of the buffer that is visible.  It also includes the choice of
     selected window.  However, it does not include the value of point
     in the current buffer; use `save-excursion' also, if you wish to
     preserve that.

     Don't use this construct when `save-selected-window' is all you
     need.

     Exit from `save-window-excursion' always triggers execution of the
     `window-size-change-functions'.  (It doesn't know how to tell
     whether the restored configuration actually differs from the one in
     effect at the end of the FORMS.)

     The return value is the value of the final form in FORMS.  For
     example:

          (split-window)
               => #<window 25 on control.texi>
          (setq w (selected-window))
               => #<window 19 on control.texi>
          (save-window-excursion
            (delete-other-windows w)
            (switch-to-buffer "foo")
            'do-something)
               => do-something
               ;; The screen is now split again.

 - Function: window-configuration-p object
     This function returns `t' if OBJECT is a window configuration.

 - Function: compare-window-configurations config1 config2
     This function compares two window configurations as regards the
     structure of windows, but ignores the values of point and mark and
     the saved scrolling positions--it can return `t' even if those
     aspects differ.

     The function `equal' can also compare two window configurations; it
     regards configurations as unequal if they differ in any respect,
     even a saved point or mark.

   Primitives to look inside of window configurations would make sense,
but none are implemented.  It is not clear they are useful enough to be
worth implementing.

Hooks for Window Scrolling and Changes
======================================

   This section describes how a Lisp program can take action whenever a
window displays a different part of its buffer or a different buffer.
There are three actions that can change this: scrolling the window,
switching buffers in the window, and changing the size of the window.
The first two actions run `window-scroll-functions'; the last runs
`window-size-change-functions'.  The paradigmatic use of these hooks is
in the implementation of Lazy Lock mode; see *Note Lazy Lock:
(emacs)Support Modes.

 - Variable: window-scroll-functions
     This variable holds a list of functions that Emacs should call
     before redisplaying a window with scrolling.  It is not a normal
     hook, because each function is called with two arguments: the
     window, and its new display-start position.

     Displaying a different buffer in the window also runs these
     functions.

     These functions must be careful in using `window-end' (*note
     Window Start::); if you need an up-to-date value, you must use the
     UPDATE argument to ensure you get it.

 - Variable: window-size-change-functions
     This variable holds a list of functions to be called if the size
     of any window changes for any reason.  The functions are called
     just once per redisplay, and just once for each frame on which
     size changes have occurred.

     Each function receives the frame as its sole argument.  There is no
     direct way to find out which windows on that frame have changed
     size, or precisely how.  However, if a size-change function
     records, at each call, the existing windows and their sizes, it
     can also compare the present sizes and the previous sizes.

     Creating or deleting windows counts as a size change, and therefore
     causes these functions to be called.  Changing the frame size also
     counts, because it changes the sizes of the existing windows.

     It is not a good idea to use `save-window-excursion' (*note Window
     Configurations::) in these functions, because that always counts
     as a size change, and it would cause these functions to be called
     over and over.  In most cases, `save-selected-window' (*note
     Selecting Windows::) is what you need here.

 - Variable: redisplay-end-trigger-functions
     This abnormal hook is run whenever redisplay in a window uses text
     that extends past a specified end trigger position.  You set the
     end trigger position with the function
     `set-window-redisplay-end-trigger'.  The functions are called with
     two arguments: the window, and the end trigger position.  Storing
     `nil' for the end trigger position turns off the feature, and the
     trigger value is automatically reset to `nil' just after the hook
     is run.

 - Function: set-window-redisplay-end-trigger window position
     This function sets WINDOW's end trigger position at POSITION.

 - Function: window-redisplay-end-trigger &optional window
     This function returns WINDOW's current end trigger position.

 - Variable: window-configuration-change-hook
     A normal hook that is run every time you change the window
     configuration of an existing frame.  This includes splitting or
     deleting windows, changing the sizes of windows, or displaying a
     different buffer in a window.  The frame whose window
     configuration has changed is the selected frame when this hook
     runs.

Frames
******

   A "frame" is a rectangle on the screen that contains one or more
Emacs windows.  A frame initially contains a single main window (plus
perhaps a minibuffer window), which you can subdivide vertically or
horizontally into smaller windows.

   When Emacs runs on a text-only terminal, it starts with one
"terminal frame".  If you create additional ones, Emacs displays one
and only one at any given time--on the terminal screen, of course.

   When Emacs communicates directly with a supported window system, such
as X, it does not have a terminal frame; instead, it starts with a
single "window frame", but you can create more, and Emacs can display
several such frames at once as is usual for window systems.

 - Function: framep object
     This predicate returns a non-`nil' value if OBJECT is a frame, and
     `nil' otherwise.  For a frame, the value indicates which kind of
     display the frame uses:

    `x'
          The frame is displayed in an X window.

    `t'
          A terminal frame on a character display.

    `mac'
          The frame is displayed on a Macintosh.

    `w32'
          The frame is displayed on MS-Windows 9X/NT.

    `pc'
          The frame is displayed on an MS-DOS terminal.

Creating Frames
===============

   To create a new frame, call the function `make-frame'.

 - Function: make-frame &optional alist
     This function creates a new frame.  If you are using a supported
     window system, it makes a window frame; otherwise, it makes a
     terminal frame.

     The argument is an alist specifying frame parameters.  Any
     parameters not mentioned in ALIST default according to the value
     of the variable `default-frame-alist'; parameters not specified
     even there default from the standard X resources or whatever is
     used instead on your system.

     The set of possible parameters depends in principle on what kind of
     window system Emacs uses to display its frames.  *Note Window
     Frame Parameters::, for documentation of individual parameters you
     can specify.

 - Variable: before-make-frame-hook
     A normal hook run by `make-frame' before it actually creates the
     frame.

 - Variable: after-make-frame-functions
     An abnormal hook run by `make-frame' after it creates the frame.
     Each function in `after-make-frame-functions' receives one
     argument, the frame just created.


File: elisp,  Node: Multiple Displays,  Next: Frame Parameters,  Prev: Creating Frames,  Up: Frames

Multiple Displays
=================

   A single Emacs can talk to more than one X display.  Initially,
Emacs uses just one display--the one chosen with the `DISPLAY'
environment variable or with the `--display' option (*note Initial
Options: (emacs)Initial Options.).  To connect to another display, use
the command `make-frame-on-display' or specify the `display' frame
parameter when you create the frame.

   Emacs treats each X server as a separate terminal, giving each one
its own selected frame and its own minibuffer windows.  However, only
one of those frames is "_the_ selected frame" at any given moment, see
*Note Input Focus::.

   A few Lisp variables are "terminal-local"; that is, they have a
separate binding for each terminal.  The binding in effect at any time
is the one for the terminal that the currently selected frame belongs
to.  These variables include `default-minibuffer-frame',
`defining-kbd-macro', `last-kbd-macro', and `system-key-alist'.  They
are always terminal-local, and can never be buffer-local (*note
Buffer-Local Variables::) or frame-local.

   A single X server can handle more than one screen.  A display name
`HOST:SERVER.SCREEN' has three parts; the last part specifies the
screen number for a given server.  When you use two screens belonging
to one server, Emacs knows by the similarity in their names that they
share a single keyboard, and it treats them as a single terminal.

 - Command: make-frame-on-display display &optional parameters
     This creates a new frame on display DISPLAY, taking the other
     frame parameters from PARAMETERS.  Aside from the DISPLAY
     argument, it is like `make-frame' (*note Creating Frames::).

 - Function: x-display-list
     This returns a list that indicates which X displays Emacs has a
     connection to.  The elements of the list are strings, and each one
     is a display name.

 - Function: x-open-connection display &optional xrm-string must-succeed
     This function opens a connection to the X display DISPLAY.  It
     does not create a frame on that display, but it permits you to
     check that communication can be established with that display.

     The optional argument XRM-STRING, if not `nil', is a string of
     resource names and values, in the same format used in the
     `.Xresources' file.  The values you specify override the resource
     values recorded in the X server itself; they apply to all Emacs
     frames created on this display.  Here's an example of what this
     string might look like:

          "*BorderWidth: 3\n*InternalBorder: 2\n"

     *Note Resources::.

     If MUST-SUCCEED is non-`nil', failure to open the connection
     terminates Emacs.  Otherwise, it is an ordinary Lisp error.

 - Function: x-close-connection display
     This function closes the connection to display DISPLAY.  Before
     you can do this, you must first delete all the frames that were
     open on that display (*note Deleting Frames::).

Frame Parameters
================

   A frame has many parameters that control its appearance and behavior.
Just what parameters a frame has depends on what display mechanism it
uses.

   Frame parameters exist mostly for the sake of window systems.  A
terminal frame has a few parameters, mostly for compatibility's sake;
only the `height', `width', `name', `title', `menu-bar-lines',
`buffer-list' and `buffer-predicate' parameters do something special.
If the terminal supports colors, the parameters `foreground-color',
`background-color', `background-mode' and `display-type' are also
meaningful.

Access to Frame Parameters
--------------------------

   These functions let you read and change the parameter values of a
frame.

 - Function: frame-parameter frame parameter
     This function returns the value of the parameter named PARAMETER
     of FRAME.  If FRAME is `nil', it returns the selected  frame's
     parameter.

 - Function: frame-parameters frame
     The function `frame-parameters' returns an alist listing all the
     parameters of FRAME and their values.

 - Function: modify-frame-parameters frame alist
     This function alters the parameters of frame FRAME based on the
     elements of ALIST.  Each element of ALIST has the form `(PARM .
     VALUE)', where PARM is a symbol naming a parameter.  If you don't
     mention a parameter in ALIST, its value doesn't change.


File: elisp,  Node: Initial Parameters,  Next: Window Frame Parameters,  Prev: Parameter Access,  Up: Frame Parameters

Initial Frame Parameters
------------------------

   You can specify the parameters for the initial startup frame by
setting `initial-frame-alist' in your init file (*note Init File::).

 - Variable: initial-frame-alist
     This variable's value is an alist of parameter values used when
     creating the initial window frame.  You can set this variable to
     specify the appearance of the initial frame without altering
     subsequent frames.  Each element has the form:

          (PARAMETER . VALUE)

     Emacs creates the initial frame before it reads your init file.
     After reading that file, Emacs checks `initial-frame-alist', and
     applies the parameter settings in the altered value to the already
     created initial frame.

     If these settings affect the frame geometry and appearance, you'll
     see the frame appear with the wrong ones and then change to the
     specified ones.  If that bothers you, you can specify the same
     geometry and appearance with X resources; those do take effect
     before the frame is created.  *Note X Resources: (emacs)Resources
     X.

     X resource settings typically apply to all frames.  If you want to
     specify some X resources solely for the sake of the initial frame,
     and you don't want them to apply to subsequent frames, here's how
     to achieve this.  Specify parameters in `default-frame-alist' to
     override the X resources for subsequent frames; then, to prevent
     these from affecting the initial frame, specify the same
     parameters in `initial-frame-alist' with values that match the X
     resources.

   If these parameters specify a separate minibuffer-only frame with
`(minibuffer . nil)', and you have not created one, Emacs creates one
for you.

 - Variable: minibuffer-frame-alist
     This variable's value is an alist of parameter values used when
     creating an initial minibuffer-only frame--if such a frame is
     needed, according to the parameters for the main initial frame.

 - Variable: default-frame-alist
     This is an alist specifying default values of frame parameters for
     all Emacs frames--the first frame, and subsequent frames.  When
     using the X Window System, you can get the same results by means
     of X resources in many cases.

   See also `special-display-frame-alist', in *Note Choosing Window::.

   If you use options that specify window appearance when you invoke
Emacs, they take effect by adding elements to `default-frame-alist'.
One exception is `-geometry', which adds the specified position to
`initial-frame-alist' instead.  *Note Command Arguments: (emacs)Command
Arguments.

Window Frame Parameters
-----------------------

   Just what parameters a frame has depends on what display mechanism it
uses.  Here is a table of the parameters that have special meanings in a
window frame; of these, `name', `title', `height', `width',
`buffer-list' and `buffer-predicate' provide meaningful information in
terminal frames.

`display'
     The display on which to open this frame.  It should be a string of
     the form `"HOST:DPY.SCREEN"', just like the `DISPLAY' environment
     variable.

`title'
     If a frame has a non-`nil' title, it appears in the window system's
     border for the frame, and also in the mode line of windows in that
     frame if `mode-line-frame-identification' uses `%F' (*note
     %-Constructs::).  This is normally the case when Emacs is not
     using a window system, and can only display one frame at a time.
     *Note Frame Titles::.

`name'
     The name of the frame.  The frame name serves as a default for the
     frame title, if the `title' parameter is unspecified or `nil'.  If
     you don't specify a name, Emacs sets the frame name automatically
     (*note Frame Titles::).

     If you specify the frame name explicitly when you create the
     frame, the name is also used (instead of the name of the Emacs
     executable) when looking up X resources for the frame.

`left'
     The screen position of the left edge, in pixels, with respect to
     the left edge of the screen.  The value may be a positive number
     POS, or a list of the form `(+ POS)' which permits specifying a
     negative POS value.

     A negative number -POS, or a list of the form `(- POS)', actually
     specifies the position of the right edge of the window with
     respect to the right edge of the screen.  A positive value of POS
     counts toward the left.  *Reminder:* if the parameter is a
     negative integer -POS, then POS is positive.

     Some window managers ignore program-specified positions.  If you
     want to be sure the position you specify is not ignored, specify a
     non-`nil' value for the `user-position' parameter as well.

`top'
     The screen position of the top edge, in pixels, with respect to the
     top edge of the screen.  The value may be a positive number POS,
     or a list of the form `(+ POS)' which permits specifying a
     negative POS value.

     A negative number -POS, or a list of the form `(- POS)', actually
     specifies the position of the bottom edge of the window with
     respect to the bottom edge of the screen.  A positive value of POS
     counts toward the top.  *Reminder:* if the parameter is a negative
     integer -POS, then POS is positive.

     Some window managers ignore program-specified positions.  If you
     want to be sure the position you specify is not ignored, specify a
     non-`nil' value for the `user-position' parameter as well.

`icon-left'
     The screen position of the left edge _of the frame's icon_, in
     pixels, counting from the left edge of the screen.  This takes
     effect if and when the frame is iconified.

`icon-top'
     The screen position of the top edge _of the frame's icon_, in
     pixels, counting from the top edge of the screen.  This takes
     effect if and when the frame is iconified.

`user-position'
     When you create a frame and specify its screen position with the
     `left' and `top' parameters, use this parameter to say whether the
     specified position was user-specified (explicitly requested in some
     way by a human user) or merely program-specified (chosen by a
     program).  A non-`nil' value says the position was user-specified.

     Window managers generally heed user-specified positions, and some
     heed program-specified positions too.  But many ignore
     program-specified positions, placing the window in a default
     fashion or letting the user place it with the mouse.  Some window
     managers, including `twm', let the user specify whether to obey
     program-specified positions or ignore them.

     When you call `make-frame', you should specify a non-`nil' value
     for this parameter if the values of the `left' and `top'
     parameters represent the user's stated preference; otherwise, use
     `nil'.

`height'
     The height of the frame contents, in characters.  (To get the
     height in pixels, call `frame-pixel-height'; see *Note Size and
     Position::.)

`width'
     The width of the frame contents, in characters.  (To get the
     height in pixels, call `frame-pixel-width'; see *Note Size and
     Position::.)

`window-id'
     The number of the window-system window used by the frame to
     contain the actual Emacs windows.

`outer-window-id'
     The number of the outermost window-system window used for the
     whole frame.

`minibuffer'
     Whether this frame has its own minibuffer.  The value `t' means
     yes, `nil' means no, `only' means this frame is just a minibuffer.
     If the value is a minibuffer window (in some other frame), the
     new frame uses that minibuffer.

`buffer-predicate'
     The buffer-predicate function for this frame.  The function
     `other-buffer' uses this predicate (from the selected frame) to
     decide which buffers it should consider, if the predicate is not
     `nil'.  It calls the predicate with one argument, a buffer, once
     for each buffer; if the predicate returns a non-`nil' value, it
     considers that buffer.

`buffer-list'
     A list of buffers that have been selected in this frame, ordered
     most-recently-selected first.

`font'
     The name of the font for displaying text in the frame.  This is a
     string, either a valid font name for your system or the name of an
     Emacs fontset (*note Fontsets::).  Changing this frame parameter
     on a frame also changes the font-related attributes of the default
     face on that frame.

`auto-raise'
     Whether selecting the frame raises it (non-`nil' means yes).

`auto-lower'
     Whether deselecting the frame lowers it (non-`nil' means yes).

`vertical-scroll-bars'
     Whether the frame has scroll bars for vertical scrolling, and
     which side of the frame they should be on.  The possible values
     are `left', `right', and `nil' for no scroll bars.

`horizontal-scroll-bars'
     Whether the frame has scroll bars for horizontal scrolling
     (non-`nil' means yes).  (Horizontal scroll bars are not currently
     implemented.)

`scroll-bar-width'
     The width of the vertical scroll bar, in pixels.

`icon-type'
     The type of icon to use for this frame when it is iconified.  If
     the value is a string, that specifies a file containing a bitmap
     to use.  Any other non-`nil' value specifies the default bitmap
     icon (a picture of a gnu); `nil' specifies a text icon.

`icon-name'
     The name to use in the icon for this frame, when and if the icon
     appears.  If this is `nil', the frame's title is used.

`foreground-color'
     The color to use for the image of a character.  This is a string;
     the window system defines the meaningful color names.  Changing
     this parameter is equivalent to changing the foreground color of
     the face `default' on the frame in question.

`background-color'
     The color to use for the background of characters.  Changing this
     parameter is equivalent to changing the foreground color of the
     face `default' on the frame in question.

`background-mode'
     This parameter is either `dark' or `light', according to whether
     the background color is a light one or a dark one.

`mouse-color'
     The color for the mouse pointer.  Changing this parameter is
     equivalent to changing the background color of face `mouse'.

`cursor-color'
     The color for the cursor that shows point. Changing this parameter
     is equivalent to changing the background color of face `cursor'.

`border-color'
     The color for the border of the frame. Changing this parameter is
     equivalent to changing the background color of face `border'.

`scroll-bar-foreground'
     If non-`nil', the color for the foreground of scroll bars.
     Changing this parameter is equivalent to setting the foreground
     color of face `scroll-bar'.

`scroll-bar-background'
     If non-`nil', the color for the background of scroll bars.
     Changing this parameter is equivalent to setting the foreground
     color of face `scroll-bar'.

`display-type'
     This parameter describes the range of possible colors that can be
     used in this frame.  Its value is `color', `grayscale' or `mono'.

`cursor-type'
     The way to display the cursor.  The legitimate values are `bar',
     `box', and `(bar . WIDTH)'.  The symbol `box' specifies an
     ordinary black box overlaying the character after point; that is
     the default.  The symbol `bar' specifies a vertical bar between
     characters as the cursor.  `(bar . WIDTH)' specifies a bar WIDTH
     pixels wide.

     The buffer-local variable `cursor-type' overrides the value of the
     `cursor-type' frame parameter, and can in addition have values `t'
     (use the cursor specified for the frame) and `nil' (don't display
     a cursor).

`border-width'
     The width in pixels of the window border.

`internal-border-width'
     The distance in pixels between text and border.

`unsplittable'
     If non-`nil', this frame's window is never split automatically.

`visibility'
     The state of visibility of the frame.  There are three
     possibilities: `nil' for invisible, `t' for visible, and `icon' for
     iconified.  *Note Visibility of Frames::.

`menu-bar-lines'
     The number of lines to allocate at the top of the frame for a menu
     bar.  The default is 1.  *Note Menu Bar::.  (In Emacs versions
     that use the X toolkit, there is only one menu bar line; all that
     matters about the number you specify is whether it is greater than
     zero.)

`screen-gamma'
     If this is a number, Emacs performs "gamma correction" on colors.
     The value should be the screen gamma of your display, a floating
     point number.  Usual PC monitors have a screen gamma of 2.2, so
     the default is to display for that gamma value.  Specifying a
     smaller value results in darker colors, which is desirable for a
     monitor that tends to display colors too light.  A screen gamma
     value of 1.5 may give good results for LCD color displays.

`tool-bar-lines'
     The number of lines to use for the toolbar.  A value of `nil' means
     don't display a tool bar.

`line-spacing'
     Additional space put below text lines in pixels (a positive
     integer).

Frame Size And Position
-----------------------

   You can read or change the size and position of a frame using the
frame parameters `left', `top', `height', and `width'.  Whatever
geometry parameters you don't specify are chosen by the window manager
in its usual fashion.

   Here are some special features for working with sizes and positions.
(For the precise meaning of "selected frame" used by these functions,
see *Note Input Focus::.)

 - Function: set-frame-position frame left top
     This function sets the position of the top left corner of FRAME to
     LEFT and TOP.  These arguments are measured in pixels, and
     normally count from the top left corner of the screen.

     Negative parameter values position the bottom edge of the window
     up from the bottom edge of the screen, or the right window edge to
     the left of the right edge of the screen.  It would probably be
     better if the values were always counted from the left and top, so
     that negative arguments would position the frame partly off the
     top or left edge of the screen, but it seems inadvisable to change
     that now.

 - Function: frame-height &optional frame
 - Function: frame-width &optional frame
     These functions return the height and width of FRAME, measured in
     lines and columns.  If you don't supply FRAME, they use the
     selected frame.

 - Function: screen-height
 - Function: screen-width
     These functions are old aliases for `frame-height' and
     `frame-width'.  When you are using a non-window terminal, the size
     of the frame is normally the same as the size of the terminal
     screen.

 - Function: frame-pixel-height &optional frame
 - Function: frame-pixel-width &optional frame
     These functions return the height and width of FRAME, measured in
     pixels.  If you don't supply FRAME, they use the selected frame.

 - Function: frame-char-height &optional frame
 - Function: frame-char-width &optional frame
     These functions return the height and width of a character in
     FRAME, measured in pixels.  The values depend on the choice of
     font.  If you don't supply FRAME, these functions use the selected
     frame.

 - Function: set-frame-size frame cols rows
     This function sets the size of FRAME, measured in characters; COLS
     and ROWS specify the new width and height.

     To set the size based on values measured in pixels, use
     `frame-char-height' and `frame-char-width' to convert them to
     units of characters.

 - Function: set-frame-height frame lines &optional pretend
     This function resizes FRAME to a height of LINES lines.  The sizes
     of existing windows in FRAME are altered proportionally to fit.

     If PRETEND is non-`nil', then Emacs displays LINES lines of output
     in FRAME, but does not change its value for the actual height of
     the frame.  This is only useful for a terminal frame.  Using a
     smaller height than the terminal actually implements may be useful
     to reproduce behavior observed on a smaller screen, or if the
     terminal malfunctions when using its whole screen.  Setting the
     frame height "for real" does not always work, because knowing the
     correct actual size may be necessary for correct cursor
     positioning on a terminal frame.

 - Function: set-frame-width frame width &optional pretend
     This function sets the width of FRAME, measured in characters.
     The argument PRETEND has the same meaning as in `set-frame-height'.

   The older functions `set-screen-height' and `set-screen-width' were
used to specify the height and width of the screen, in Emacs versions
that did not support multiple frames.  They are semi-obsolete, but
still work; they apply to the selected frame.

 - Function: x-parse-geometry geom
     The function `x-parse-geometry' converts a standard X window
     geometry string to an alist that you can use as part of the
     argument to `make-frame'.

     The alist describes which parameters were specified in GEOM, and
     gives the values specified for them.  Each element looks like
     `(PARAMETER . VALUE)'.  The possible PARAMETER values are `left',
     `top', `width', and `height'.

     For the size parameters, the value must be an integer.  The
     position parameter names `left' and `top' are not totally accurate,
     because some values indicate the position of the right or bottom
     edges instead.  These are the VALUE possibilities for the position
     parameters:

    an integer
          A positive integer relates the left edge or top edge of the
          window to the left or top edge of the screen.  A negative
          integer relates the right or bottom edge of the window to the
          right or bottom edge of the screen.

    `(+ POSITION)'
          This specifies the position of the left or top edge of the
          window relative to the left or top edge of the screen.  The
          integer POSITION may be positive or negative; a negative
          value specifies a position outside the screen.

    `(- POSITION)'
          This specifies the position of the right or bottom edge of
          the window relative to the right or bottom edge of the
          screen.  The integer POSITION may be positive or negative; a
          negative value specifies a position outside the screen.

     Here is an example:

          (x-parse-geometry "35x70+0-0")
               => ((height . 70) (width . 35)
                   (top - 0) (left . 0))

Frame Titles
============

   Every frame has a `name' parameter; this serves as the default for
the frame title which window systems typically display at the top of
the frame.  You can specify a name explicitly by setting the `name'
frame property.

   Normally you don't specify the name explicitly, and Emacs computes
the frame name automatically based on a template stored in the variable
`frame-title-format'.  Emacs recomputes the name each time the frame is
redisplayed.

 - Variable: frame-title-format
     This variable specifies how to compute a name for a frame when you
     have not explicitly specified one.  The variable's value is
     actually a mode line construct, just like `mode-line-format'.
     *Note Mode Line Data::.

 - Variable: icon-title-format
     This variable specifies how to compute the name for an iconified
     frame, when you have not explicitly specified the frame title.
     This title appears in the icon itself.

 - Variable: multiple-frames
     This variable is set automatically by Emacs.  Its value is `t' when
     there are two or more frames (not counting minibuffer-only frames
     or invisible frames).  The default value of `frame-title-format'
     uses `multiple-frames' so as to put the buffer name in the frame
     title only when there is more than one frame.


File: elisp,  Node: Deleting Frames,  Next: Finding All Frames,  Prev: Frame Titles,  Up: Frames

Deleting Frames
===============

   Frames remain potentially visible until you explicitly "delete"
them.  A deleted frame cannot appear on the screen, but continues to
exist as a Lisp object until there are no references to it.  There is no
way to cancel the deletion of a frame aside from restoring a saved frame
configuration (*note Frame Configurations::); this is similar to the
way windows behave.

 - Command: delete-frame &optional frame force
     This function deletes the frame FRAME after running the hook
     `delete-frame-hook'.  By default, FRAME is the selected frame.

     A frame cannot be deleted if its minibuffer is used by other
     frames.  Normally, you cannot delete a frame if all other frames
     are invisible, but if the FORCE is non-`nil', then you are allowed
     to do so.

 - Function: frame-live-p frame
     The function `frame-live-p' returns non-`nil' if the frame FRAME
     has not been deleted.

   Some window managers provide a command to delete a window.  These
work by sending a special message to the program that operates the
window.  When Emacs gets one of these commands, it generates a
`delete-frame' event, whose normal definition is a command that calls
the function `delete-frame'.  *Note Misc Events::.


File: elisp,  Node: Finding All Frames,  Next: Frames and Windows,  Prev: Deleting Frames,  Up: Frames

Finding All Frames
==================

 - Function: frame-list
     The function `frame-list' returns a list of all the frames that
     have not been deleted.  It is analogous to `buffer-list' for
     buffers, and includes frames on all terminals.  The list that you
     get is newly created, so modifying the list doesn't have any
     effect on the internals of Emacs.

 - Function: visible-frame-list
     This function returns a list of just the currently visible frames.
     *Note Visibility of Frames::.  (Terminal frames always count as
     "visible", even though only the selected one is actually
     displayed.)

 - Function: next-frame &optional frame minibuf
     The function `next-frame' lets you cycle conveniently through all
     the frames on the current display from an arbitrary starting
     point.  It returns the "next" frame after FRAME in the cycle.  If
     FRAME is omitted or `nil', it defaults to the selected frame
     (*note Input Focus::).

     The second argument, MINIBUF, says which frames to consider:

    `nil'
          Exclude minibuffer-only frames.

    `visible'
          Consider all visible frames.

    0
          Consider all visible or iconified frames.

    a window
          Consider only the frames using that particular window as their
          minibuffer.

    anything else
          Consider all frames.

 - Function: previous-frame &optional frame minibuf
     Like `next-frame', but cycles through all frames in the opposite
     direction.

   See also `next-window' and `previous-window', in *Note Cyclic Window
Ordering::.


File: elisp,  Node: Frames and Windows,  Next: Minibuffers and Frames,  Prev: Finding All Frames,  Up: Frames

Frames and Windows
==================

   Each window is part of one and only one frame; you can get the frame
with `window-frame'.

 - Function: window-frame window
     This function returns the frame that WINDOW is on.

   All the non-minibuffer windows in a frame are arranged in a cyclic
order.  The order runs from the frame's top window, which is at the
upper left corner, down and to the right, until it reaches the window at
the lower right corner (always the minibuffer window, if the frame has
one), and then it moves back to the top.  *Note Cyclic Window
Ordering::.

 - Function: frame-first-window frame
     This returns the topmost, leftmost window of frame FRAME.

   At any time, exactly one window on any frame is "selected within the
frame".  The significance of this designation is that selecting the
frame also selects this window.  You can get the frame's current
selected window with `frame-selected-window'.

 - Function: frame-selected-window frame
     This function returns the window on FRAME that is selected within
     FRAME.

   Conversely, selecting a window for Emacs with `select-window' also
makes that window selected within its frame.  *Note Selecting Windows::.

   Another function that (usually) returns one of the windows in a given
frame is `minibuffer-window'.  *Note Minibuffer Misc::.


File: elisp,  Node: Minibuffers and Frames,  Next: Input Focus,  Prev: Frames and Windows,  Up: Frames

Minibuffers and Frames
======================

   Normally, each frame has its own minibuffer window at the bottom,
which is used whenever that frame is selected.  If the frame has a
minibuffer, you can get it with `minibuffer-window' (*note Minibuffer
Misc::).

   However, you can also create a frame with no minibuffer.  Such a
frame must use the minibuffer window of some other frame.  When you
create the frame, you can specify explicitly the minibuffer window to
use (in some other frame).  If you don't, then the minibuffer is found
in the frame which is the value of the variable
`default-minibuffer-frame'.  Its value should be a frame that does have
a minibuffer.

   If you use a minibuffer-only frame, you might want that frame to
raise when you enter the minibuffer.  If so, set the variable
`minibuffer-auto-raise' to `t'.  *Note Raising and Lowering::.

 - Variable: default-minibuffer-frame
     This variable specifies the frame to use for the minibuffer
     window, by default.  It is always local to the current terminal
     and cannot be buffer-local.  *Note Multiple Displays::.
