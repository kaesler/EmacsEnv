Looking Up and Expanding Abbreviations
======================================

   Abbrevs are usually expanded by certain interactive commands,
including `self-insert-command'.  This section describes the
subroutines used in writing such commands, as well as the variables they
use for communication.

 - Function: abbrev-symbol abbrev &optional table
     This function returns the symbol representing the abbrev named
     ABBREV.  The value returned is `nil' if that abbrev is not
     defined.  The optional second argument TABLE is the abbrev table
     to look it up in.  If TABLE is `nil', this function tries first
     the current buffer's local abbrev table, and second the global
     abbrev table.

 - Function: abbrev-expansion abbrev &optional table
     This function returns the string that ABBREV would expand into (as
     defined by the abbrev tables used for the current buffer).  The
     optional argument TABLE specifies the abbrev table to use, as in
     `abbrev-symbol'.

 - Command: expand-abbrev
     This command expands the abbrev before point, if any.  If point
     does not follow an abbrev, this command does nothing.  The command
     returns the abbrev symbol if it did expansion, `nil' otherwise.

     If the abbrev symbol has a hook function which is a symbol whose
     `no-self-insert' property is non-`nil', and if the hook function
     returns `nil' as its value, then `expand-abbrev' returns `nil'
     even though expansion did occur.

 - Command: abbrev-prefix-mark &optional arg
     Mark current point as the beginning of an abbrev.  The next call to
     `expand-abbrev' will use the text from here to point (where it is
     then) as the abbrev to expand, rather than using the previous word
     as usual.

 - User Option: abbrev-all-caps
     When this is set non-`nil', an abbrev entered entirely in upper
     case is expanded using all upper case.  Otherwise, an abbrev
     entered entirely in upper case is expanded by capitalizing each
     word of the expansion.

 - Variable: abbrev-start-location
     This is the buffer position for `expand-abbrev' to use as the start
     of the next abbrev to be expanded.  (`nil' means use the word
     before point instead.)  `abbrev-start-location' is set to `nil'
     each time `expand-abbrev' is called.  This variable is also set by
     `abbrev-prefix-mark'.

 - Variable: abbrev-start-location-buffer
     The value of this variable is the buffer for which
     `abbrev-start-location' has been set.  Trying to expand an abbrev
     in any other buffer clears `abbrev-start-location'.  This variable
     is set by `abbrev-prefix-mark'.

 - Variable: last-abbrev
     This is the `abbrev-symbol' of the most recent abbrev expanded.
     This information is left by `expand-abbrev' for the sake of the
     `unexpand-abbrev' command (*note Expanding Abbrevs:
     (emacs)Expanding Abbrevs.).

 - Variable: last-abbrev-location
     This is the location of the most recent abbrev expanded.  This
     contains information left by `expand-abbrev' for the sake of the
     `unexpand-abbrev' command.

 - Variable: last-abbrev-text
     This is the exact expansion text of the most recent abbrev
     expanded, after case conversion (if any).  Its value is `nil' if
     the abbrev has already been unexpanded.  This contains information
     left by `expand-abbrev' for the sake of the `unexpand-abbrev'
     command.

 - Variable: pre-abbrev-expand-hook
     This is a normal hook whose functions are executed, in sequence,
     just before any expansion of an abbrev.  *Note Hooks::.  Since it
     is a normal hook, the hook functions receive no arguments.
     However, they can find the abbrev to be expanded by looking in the
     buffer before point.  Running the hook is the first thing that
     `expand-abbrev' does, and so a hook function can be used to change
     the current abbrev table before abbrev lookup happens.

   The following sample code shows a simple use of
`pre-abbrev-expand-hook'.  If the user terminates an abbrev with a
punctuation character, the hook function asks for confirmation.  Thus,
this hook allows the user to decide whether to expand the abbrev, and
aborts expansion if it is not confirmed.

     (add-hook 'pre-abbrev-expand-hook 'query-if-not-space)
     
     ;; This is the function invoked by `pre-abbrev-expand-hook'.
     
     ;; If the user terminated the abbrev with a space, the function does
     ;; nothing (that is, it returns so that the abbrev can expand).  If the
     ;; user entered some other character, this function asks whether
     ;; expansion should continue.
     
     ;; If the user answers the prompt with `y', the function returns
     ;; `nil' (because of the `not' function), but that is
     ;; acceptable; the return value has no effect on expansion.
     
     (defun query-if-not-space ()
       (if (/= ?\  (preceding-char))
           (if (not (y-or-n-p "Do you want to expand this abbrev? "))
               (error "Not expanding this abbrev"))))

Standard Abbrev Tables
======================

   Here we list the variables that hold the abbrev tables for the
preloaded major modes of Emacs.

 - Variable: global-abbrev-table
     This is the abbrev table for mode-independent abbrevs.  The abbrevs
     defined in it apply to all buffers.  Each buffer may also have a
     local abbrev table, whose abbrev definitions take precedence over
     those in the global table.

 - Variable: local-abbrev-table
     The value of this buffer-local variable is the (mode-specific)
     abbreviation table of the current buffer.

 - Variable: fundamental-mode-abbrev-table
     This is the local abbrev table used in Fundamental mode; in other
     words, it is the local abbrev table in all buffers in Fundamental
     mode.

 - Variable: text-mode-abbrev-table
     This is the local abbrev table used in Text mode.

 - Variable: lisp-mode-abbrev-table
     This is the local abbrev table used in Lisp mode and Emacs Lisp
     mode.

Processes
*********

   In the terminology of operating systems, a "process" is a space in
which a program can execute.  Emacs runs in a process.  Emacs Lisp
programs can invoke other programs in processes of their own.  These are
called "subprocesses" or "child processes" of the Emacs process, which
is their "parent process".

   A subprocess of Emacs may be "synchronous" or "asynchronous",
depending on how it is created.  When you create a synchronous
subprocess, the Lisp program waits for the subprocess to terminate
before continuing execution.  When you create an asynchronous
subprocess, it can run in parallel with the Lisp program.  This kind of
subprocess is represented within Emacs by a Lisp object which is also
called a "process".  Lisp programs can use this object to communicate
with the subprocess or to control it.  For example, you can send
signals, obtain status information, receive output from the process, or
send input to it.

 - Function: processp object
     This function returns `t' if OBJECT is a process, `nil' otherwise.

Functions that Create Subprocesses
==================================

   There are three functions that create a new subprocess in which to
run a program.  One of them, `start-process', creates an asynchronous
process and returns a process object (*note Asynchronous Processes::).
The other two, `call-process' and `call-process-region', create a
synchronous process and do not return a process object (*note
Synchronous Processes::).

   Synchronous and asynchronous processes are explained in the following
sections.  Since the three functions are all called in a similar
fashion, their common arguments are described here.

   In all cases, the function's PROGRAM argument specifies the program
to be run.  An error is signaled if the file is not found or cannot be
executed.  If the file name is relative, the variable `exec-path'
contains a list of directories to search.  Emacs initializes
`exec-path' when it starts up, based on the value of the environment
variable `PATH'.  The standard file name constructs, `~', `.', and
`..', are interpreted as usual in `exec-path', but environment variable
substitutions (`$HOME', etc.) are not recognized; use
`substitute-in-file-name' to perform them (*note File Name Expansion::).

   Each of the subprocess-creating functions has a BUFFER-OR-NAME
argument which specifies where the standard output from the program will
go.  It should be a buffer or a buffer name; if it is a buffer name,
that will create the buffer if it does not already exist.  It can also
be `nil', which says to discard the output unless a filter function
handles it.  (*Note Filter Functions::, and *Note Read and Print::.)
Normally, you should avoid having multiple processes send output to the
same buffer because their output would be intermixed randomly.

   All three of the subprocess-creating functions have a `&rest'
argument, ARGS.  The ARGS must all be strings, and they are supplied to
PROGRAM as separate command line arguments.  Wildcard characters and
other shell constructs have no special meanings in these strings, since
the whole strings are passed directly to the specified program.

   *Please note:* The argument PROGRAM contains only the name of the
program; it may not contain any command-line arguments.  You must use
ARGS to provide those.

   The subprocess gets its current directory from the value of
`default-directory' (*note File Name Expansion::).

   The subprocess inherits its environment from Emacs, but you can
specify overrides for it with `process-environment'.  *Note System
Environment::.

 - Variable: exec-directory
     The value of this variable is a string, the name of a directory
     that contains programs that come with GNU Emacs, programs intended
     for Emacs to invoke.  The program `movemail' is an example of such
     a program; Rmail uses it to fetch new mail from an inbox.

 - User Option: exec-path
     The value of this variable is a list of directories to search for
     programs to run in subprocesses.  Each element is either the name
     of a directory (i.e., a string), or `nil', which stands for the
     default directory (which is the value of `default-directory').

     The value of `exec-path' is used by `call-process' and
     `start-process' when the PROGRAM argument is not an absolute file
     name.


File: elisp,  Node: Shell Arguments,  Next: Synchronous Processes,  Prev: Subprocess Creation,  Up: Processes

Shell Arguments
===============

   Lisp programs sometimes need to run a shell and give it a command
that contains file names that were specified by the user.  These
programs ought to be able to support any valid file name.  But the shell
gives special treatment to certain characters, and if these characters
occur in the file name, they will confuse the shell.  To handle these
characters, use the function `shell-quote-argument':

 - Function: shell-quote-argument argument
     This function returns a string which represents, in shell syntax,
     an argument whose actual contents are ARGUMENT.  It should work
     reliably to concatenate the return value into a shell command and
     then pass it to a shell for execution.

     Precisely what this function does depends on your operating
     system.  The function is designed to work with the syntax of your
     system's standard shell; if you use an unusual shell, you will
     need to redefine this function.

          ;; This example shows the behavior on GNU and Unix systems.
          (shell-quote-argument "foo > bar")
               => "foo\\ \\>\\ bar"
          
          ;; This example shows the behavior on MS-DOS and MS-Windows systems.
          (shell-quote-argument "foo > bar")
               => "\"foo > bar\""

     Here's an example of using `shell-quote-argument' to construct a
     shell command:

          (concat "diff -c "
                  (shell-quote-argument oldfile)
                  " "
                  (shell-quote-argument newfile))


File: elisp,  Node: Synchronous Processes,  Next: Asynchronous Processes,  Prev: Shell Arguments,  Up: Processes

Creating a Synchronous Process
==============================

   After a "synchronous process" is created, Emacs waits for the
process to terminate before continuing.  Starting Dired on GNU or
Unix(1) is an example of this: it runs `ls' in a synchronous process,
then modifies the output slightly.  Because the process is synchronous,
the entire directory listing arrives in the buffer before Emacs tries
to do anything with it.

   While Emacs waits for the synchronous subprocess to terminate, the
user can quit by typing `C-g'.  The first `C-g' tries to kill the
subprocess with a `SIGINT' signal; but it waits until the subprocess
actually terminates before quitting.  If during that time the user
types another `C-g', that kills the subprocess instantly with `SIGKILL'
and quits immediately (except on MS-DOS, where killing other processes
doesn't work).  *Note Quitting::.

   The synchronous subprocess functions return an indication of how the
process terminated.

   The output from a synchronous subprocess is generally decoded using a
coding system, much like text read from a file.  The input sent to a
subprocess by `call-process-region' is encoded using a coding system,
much like text written into a file.  *Note Coding Systems::.

 - Function: call-process program &optional infile destination display
          &rest args
     This function calls PROGRAM in a separate process and waits for it
     to finish.

     The standard input for the process comes from file INFILE if
     INFILE is not `nil', and from the null device otherwise.  The
     argument DESTINATION says where to put the process output.  Here
     are the possibilities:

    a buffer
          Insert the output in that buffer, before point.  This
          includes both the standard output stream and the standard
          error stream of the process.

    a string
          Insert the output in a buffer with that name, before point.

    `t'
          Insert the output in the current buffer, before point.

    `nil'
          Discard the output.

    0
          Discard the output, and return `nil' immediately without
          waiting for the subprocess to finish.

          In this case, the process is not truly synchronous, since it
          can run in parallel with Emacs; but you can think of it as
          synchronous in that Emacs is essentially finished with the
          subprocess as soon as this function returns.

          MS-DOS doesn't support asynchronous subprocesses, so this
          option doesn't work there.

    `(REAL-DESTINATION ERROR-DESTINATION)'
          Keep the standard output stream separate from the standard
          error stream; deal with the ordinary output as specified by
          REAL-DESTINATION, and dispose of the error output according
          to ERROR-DESTINATION.  If ERROR-DESTINATION is `nil', that
          means to discard the error output, `t' means mix it with the
          ordinary output, and a string specifies a file name to
          redirect error output into.

          You can't directly specify a buffer to put the error output
          in; that is too difficult to implement.  But you can achieve
          this result by sending the error output to a temporary file
          and then inserting the file into a buffer.

     If DISPLAY is non-`nil', then `call-process' redisplays the buffer
     as output is inserted.  (However, if the coding system chosen for
     decoding output is `undecided', meaning deduce the encoding from
     the actual data, then redisplay sometimes cannot continue once
     non-ASCII characters are encountered.  There are fundamental
     reasons why it is hard to fix this; see *Note Output from
     Processes::.)

     Otherwise the function `call-process' does no redisplay, and the
     results become visible on the screen only when Emacs redisplays
     that buffer in the normal course of events.

     The remaining arguments, ARGS, are strings that specify command
     line arguments for the program.

     The value returned by `call-process' (unless you told it not to
     wait) indicates the reason for process termination.  A number
     gives the exit status of the subprocess; 0 means success, and any
     other value means failure.  If the process terminated with a
     signal, `call-process' returns a string describing the signal.

     In the examples below, the buffer `foo' is current.

          (call-process "pwd" nil t)
               => 0
          
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          /usr/user/lewis/manual
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          
          (call-process "grep" nil "bar" nil "lewis" "/etc/passwd")
               => 0
          
          ---------- Buffer: bar ----------
          lewis:5LTsHm66CSWKg:398:21:Bil Lewis:/user/lewis:/bin/csh
          
          ---------- Buffer: bar ----------

     Here is a good example of the use of `call-process', which used to
     be found in the definition of `insert-directory':

          (call-process insert-directory-program nil t nil SWITCHES
                        (if full-directory-p
                            (concat (file-name-as-directory file) ".")
                          file))

 - Function: call-process-region start end program &optional delete
          destination display &rest args
     This function sends the text from START to END as standard input
     to a process running PROGRAM.  It deletes the text sent if DELETE
     is non-`nil'; this is useful when DESTINATION is `t', to insert
     the output in the current buffer in place of the input.

     The arguments DESTINATION and DISPLAY control what to do with the
     output from the subprocess, and whether to update the display as
     it comes in.  For details, see the description of `call-process',
     above.  If DESTINATION is the integer 0, `call-process-region'
     discards the output and returns `nil' immediately, without waiting
     for the subprocess to finish (this only works if asynchronous
     subprocesses are supported).

     The remaining arguments, ARGS, are strings that specify command
     line arguments for the program.

     The return value of `call-process-region' is just like that of
     `call-process': `nil' if you told it to return without waiting;
     otherwise, a number or string which indicates how the subprocess
     terminated.

     In the following example, we use `call-process-region' to run the
     `cat' utility, with standard input being the first five characters
     in buffer `foo' (the word `input').  `cat' copies its standard
     input into its standard output.  Since the argument DESTINATION is
     `t', this output is inserted in the current buffer.

          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          input-!-
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          
          (call-process-region 1 6 "cat" nil t)
               => 0
          
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          inputinput-!-
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------

     The `shell-command-on-region' command uses `call-process-region'
     like this:

          (call-process-region
           start end
           shell-file-name      ; Name of program.
           nil                  ; Do not delete region.
           buffer               ; Send output to `buffer'.
           nil                  ; No redisplay during output.
           "-c" command)        ; Arguments for the shell.

 - Function: shell-command-to-string command
     This function executes COMMAND (a string) as a shell command, then
     returns the command's output as a string.

Creating an Asynchronous Process
================================

   After an "asynchronous process" is created, Emacs and the subprocess
both continue running immediately.  The process thereafter runs in
parallel with Emacs, and the two can communicate with each other using
the functions described in the following sections.  However,
communication is only partially asynchronous: Emacs sends data to the
process only when certain functions are called, and Emacs accepts data
from the process only when Emacs is waiting for input or for a time
delay.

   Here we describe how to create an asynchronous process.

 - Function: start-process name buffer-or-name program &rest args
     This function creates a new asynchronous subprocess and starts the
     program PROGRAM running in it.  It returns a process object that
     stands for the new subprocess in Lisp.  The argument NAME
     specifies the name for the process object; if a process with this
     name already exists, then NAME is modified (by appending `<1>',
     etc.) to be unique.  The buffer BUFFER-OR-NAME is the buffer to
     associate with the process.

     The remaining arguments, ARGS, are strings that specify command
     line arguments for the program.

     In the example below, the first process is started and runs
     (rather, sleeps) for 100 seconds.  Meanwhile, the second process
     is started, and given the name `my-process<1>' for the sake of
     uniqueness.  It inserts the directory listing at the end of the
     buffer `foo', before the first process finishes.  Then it
     finishes, and a message to that effect is inserted in the buffer.
     Much later, the first process finishes, and another message is
     inserted in the buffer for it.

          (start-process "my-process" "foo" "sleep" "100")
               => #<process my-process>
          
          (start-process "my-process" "foo" "ls" "-l" "/user/lewis/bin")
               => #<process my-process<1>>
          
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          total 2
          lrwxrwxrwx  1 lewis     14 Jul 22 10:12 gnuemacs --> /emacs
          -rwxrwxrwx  1 lewis     19 Jul 30 21:02 lemon
          
          Process my-process<1> finished
          
          Process my-process finished
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------

 - Function: start-process-shell-command name buffer-or-name command
          &rest command-args
     This function is like `start-process' except that it uses a shell
     to execute the specified command.  The argument COMMAND is a shell
     command name, and COMMAND-ARGS are the arguments for the shell
     command.  The variable `shell-file-name' specifies which shell to
     use.

     The point of running a program through the shell, rather than
     directly with `start-process', is so that you can employ shell
     features such as wildcards in the arguments.  It follows that if
     you include an arbitrary user-specified arguments in the command,
     you should quote it with `shell-quote-argument' first, so that any
     special shell characters do _not_ have their special shell
     meanings.  *Note Shell Arguments::.

 - Variable: process-connection-type
     This variable controls the type of device used to communicate with
     asynchronous subprocesses.  If it is non-`nil', then PTYs are
     used, when available.  Otherwise, pipes are used.

     PTYs are usually preferable for processes visible to the user, as
     in Shell mode, because they allow job control (`C-c', `C-z', etc.)
     to work between the process and its children, whereas pipes do
     not.  For subprocesses used for internal purposes by programs, it
     is often better to use a pipe, because they are more efficient.  In
     addition, the total number of PTYs is limited on many systems and
     it is good not to waste them.

     The value of `process-connection-type' is used when
     `start-process' is called.  So you can specify how to communicate
     with one subprocess by binding the variable around the call to
     `start-process'.

          (let ((process-connection-type nil))  ; Use a pipe.
            (start-process ...))

     To determine whether a given subprocess actually got a pipe or a
     PTY, use the function `process-tty-name' (*note Process
     Information::).

Deleting Processes
==================

   "Deleting a process" disconnects Emacs immediately from the
subprocess, and removes it from the list of active processes.  It sends
a signal to the subprocess to make the subprocess terminate, but this is
not guaranteed to happen immediately.  The process object itself
continues to exist as long as other Lisp objects point to it.  The
process mark continues to point to the same place as before (usually
into a buffer where output from the process was being inserted).

   You can delete a process explicitly at any time.  Processes are
deleted automatically after they terminate, but not necessarily right
away.  If you delete a terminated process explicitly before it is
deleted automatically, no harm results.

 - User Option: delete-exited-processes
     This variable controls automatic deletion of processes that have
     terminated (due to calling `exit' or to a signal).  If it is
     `nil', then they continue to exist until the user runs
     `list-processes'.  Otherwise, they are deleted immediately after
     they exit.

 - Function: delete-process name
     This function deletes the process associated with NAME, killing it
     with a `SIGHUP' signal.  The argument NAME may be a process, the
     name of a process, a buffer, or the name of a buffer.

          (delete-process "*shell*")
               => nil

 - Function: process-kill-without-query process &optional do-query
     This function specifies whether Emacs should query the user if
     PROCESS is still running when Emacs is exited.  If DO-QUERY is
     `nil', the process will be deleted silently.  Otherwise, Emacs
     will query about killing it.

     The value is `t' if the process was formerly set up to require
     query, `nil' otherwise.  A newly-created process always requires
     query.

          (process-kill-without-query (get-process "shell"))
               => t

Process Information
===================

   Several functions return information about processes.
`list-processes' is provided for interactive use.

 - Command: list-processes
     This command displays a listing of all living processes.  In
     addition, it finally deletes any process whose status was `Exited'
     or `Signaled'.  It returns `nil'.

 - Function: process-list
     This function returns a list of all processes that have not been
     deleted.

          (process-list)
               => (#<process display-time> #<process shell>)

 - Function: get-process name
     This function returns the process named NAME, or `nil' if there is
     none.  An error is signaled if NAME is not a string.

          (get-process "shell")
               => #<process shell>

 - Function: process-command process
     This function returns the command that was executed to start
     PROCESS.  This is a list of strings, the first string being the
     program executed and the rest of the strings being the arguments
     that were given to the program.

          (process-command (get-process "shell"))
               => ("/bin/csh" "-i")

 - Function: process-id process
     This function returns the PID of PROCESS.  This is an integer that
     distinguishes the process PROCESS from all other processes running
     on the same computer at the current time.  The PID of a process is
     chosen by the operating system kernel when the process is started
     and remains constant as long as the process exists.

 - Function: process-name process
     This function returns the name of PROCESS.

 - Function: process-contact process
     This function returns `t' for an ordinary child process, and
     `(HOSTNAME SERVICE)' for a net connection (*note Network::).

 - Function: process-status process-name
     This function returns the status of PROCESS-NAME as a symbol.  The
     argument PROCESS-NAME must be a process, a buffer, a process name
     (string) or a buffer name (string).

     The possible values for an actual subprocess are:

    `run'
          for a process that is running.

    `stop'
          for a process that is stopped but continuable.

    `exit'
          for a process that has exited.

    `signal'
          for a process that has received a fatal signal.

    `open'
          for a network connection that is open.

    `closed'
          for a network connection that is closed.  Once a connection
          is closed, you cannot reopen it, though you might be able to
          open a new connection to the same place.

    `nil'
          if PROCESS-NAME is not the name of an existing process.

          (process-status "shell")
               => run
          (process-status (get-buffer "*shell*"))
               => run
          x
               => #<process xx<1>>
          (process-status x)
               => exit

     For a network connection, `process-status' returns one of the
     symbols `open' or `closed'.  The latter means that the other side
     closed the connection, or Emacs did `delete-process'.

 - Function: process-exit-status process
     This function returns the exit status of PROCESS or the signal
     number that killed it.  (Use the result of `process-status' to
     determine which of those it is.)  If PROCESS has not yet
     terminated, the value is 0.

 - Function: process-tty-name process
     This function returns the terminal name that PROCESS is using for
     its communication with Emacs--or `nil' if it is using pipes
     instead of a terminal (see `process-connection-type' in *Note
     Asynchronous Processes::).

 - Function: process-coding-system process
     This function returns a cons cell describing the coding systems in
     use for decoding output from PROCESS and for encoding input to
     PROCESS (*note Coding Systems::).  The value has this form:

          (CODING-SYSTEM-FOR-DECODING . CODING-SYSTEM-FOR-ENCODING)

 - Function: set-process-coding-system process decoding-system
          encoding-system
     This function specifies the coding systems to use for subsequent
     output from and input to PROCESS.  It will use DECODING-SYSTEM to
     decode subprocess output, and ENCODING-SYSTEM to encode subprocess
     input.

Sending Input to Processes
==========================

   Asynchronous subprocesses receive input when it is sent to them by
Emacs, which is done with the functions in this section.  You must
specify the process to send input to, and the input data to send.  The
data appears on the "standard input" of the subprocess.

   Some operating systems have limited space for buffered input in a
PTY.  On these systems, Emacs sends an EOF periodically amidst the
other characters, to force them through.  For most programs, these EOFs
do no harm.

   Subprocess input is normally encoded using a coding system before the
subprocess receives it, much like text written into a file.  You can use
`set-process-coding-system' to specify which coding system to use
(*note Process Information::).  Otherwise, the coding system comes from
`coding-system-for-write', if that is non-`nil'; or else from the
defaulting mechanism (*note Default Coding Systems::).

   Sometimes the system is unable to accept input for that process,
because the input buffer is full.  When this happens, the send functions
wait a short while, accepting output from subprocesses, and then try
again.  This gives the subprocess a chance to read more of its pending
input and make space in the buffer.  It also allows filters, sentinels
and timers to run--so take account of that in writing your code.

 - Function: process-send-string process-name string
     This function sends PROCESS-NAME the contents of STRING as
     standard input.  The argument PROCESS-NAME must be a process or
     the name of a process.  If it is `nil', the current buffer's
     process is used.

     The function returns `nil'.

          (process-send-string "shell<1>" "ls\n")
               => nil
          
          
          ---------- Buffer: *shell* ----------
          ...
          introduction.texi               syntax-tables.texi~
          introduction.texi~              text.texi
          introduction.txt                text.texi~
          ...
          ---------- Buffer: *shell* ----------

 - Function: process-send-region process-name start end
     This function sends the text in the region defined by START and
     END as standard input to PROCESS-NAME, which is a process or a
     process name.  (If it is `nil', the current buffer's process is
     used.)

     An error is signaled unless both START and END are integers or
     markers that indicate positions in the current buffer.  (It is
     unimportant which number is larger.)

 - Function: process-send-eof &optional process-name
     This function makes PROCESS-NAME see an end-of-file in its input.
     The EOF comes after any text already sent to it.

     If PROCESS-NAME is not supplied, or if it is `nil', then this
     function sends the EOF to the current buffer's process.  An error
     is signaled if the current buffer has no process.

     The function returns PROCESS-NAME.

          (process-send-eof "shell")
               => "shell"

 - Function: process-running-child-p process
     This function will tell you whether a subprocess has given control
     of its terminal to its own child process.  The value is `t' if
     this is true, or if Emacs cannot tell; it is `nil' if Emacs can be
     certain that this is not so.

Sending Signals to Processes
============================

   "Sending a signal" to a subprocess is a way of interrupting its
activities.  There are several different signals, each with its own
meaning.  The set of signals and their names is defined by the operating
system.  For example, the signal `SIGINT' means that the user has typed
`C-c', or that some analogous thing has happened.

   Each signal has a standard effect on the subprocess.  Most signals
kill the subprocess, but some stop or resume execution instead.  Most
signals can optionally be handled by programs; if the program handles
the signal, then we can say nothing in general about its effects.

   You can send signals explicitly by calling the functions in this
section.  Emacs also sends signals automatically at certain times:
killing a buffer sends a `SIGHUP' signal to all its associated
processes; killing Emacs sends a `SIGHUP' signal to all remaining
processes.  (`SIGHUP' is a signal that usually indicates that the user
hung up the phone.)

   Each of the signal-sending functions takes two optional arguments:
PROCESS-NAME and CURRENT-GROUP.

   The argument PROCESS-NAME must be either a process, the name of one,
or `nil'.  If it is `nil', the process defaults to the process
associated with the current buffer.  An error is signaled if
PROCESS-NAME does not identify a process.

   The argument CURRENT-GROUP is a flag that makes a difference when
you are running a job-control shell as an Emacs subprocess.  If it is
non-`nil', then the signal is sent to the current process-group of the
terminal that Emacs uses to communicate with the subprocess.  If the
process is a job-control shell, this means the shell's current subjob.
If it is `nil', the signal is sent to the process group of the
immediate subprocess of Emacs.  If the subprocess is a job-control
shell, this is the shell itself.

   The flag CURRENT-GROUP has no effect when a pipe is used to
communicate with the subprocess, because the operating system does not
support the distinction in the case of pipes.  For the same reason,
job-control shells won't work when a pipe is used.  See
`process-connection-type' in *Note Asynchronous Processes::.

 - Function: interrupt-process &optional process-name current-group
     This function interrupts the process PROCESS-NAME by sending the
     signal `SIGINT'.  Outside of Emacs, typing the "interrupt
     character" (normally `C-c' on some systems, and `DEL' on others)
     sends this signal.  When the argument CURRENT-GROUP is non-`nil',
     you can think of this function as "typing `C-c'" on the terminal
     by which Emacs talks to the subprocess.

 - Function: kill-process &optional process-name current-group
     This function kills the process PROCESS-NAME by sending the signal
     `SIGKILL'.  This signal kills the subprocess immediately, and
     cannot be handled by the subprocess.

 - Function: quit-process &optional process-name current-group
     This function sends the signal `SIGQUIT' to the process
     PROCESS-NAME.  This signal is the one sent by the "quit character"
     (usually `C-b' or `C-\') when you are not inside Emacs.

 - Function: stop-process &optional process-name current-group
     This function stops the process PROCESS-NAME by sending the signal
     `SIGTSTP'.  Use `continue-process' to resume its execution.

     Outside of Emacs, on systems with job control, the "stop character"
     (usually `C-z') normally sends this signal.  When CURRENT-GROUP is
     non-`nil', you can think of this function as "typing `C-z'" on the
     terminal Emacs uses to communicate with the subprocess.

 - Function: continue-process &optional process-name current-group
     This function resumes execution of the process PROCESS by sending
     it the signal `SIGCONT'.  This presumes that PROCESS-NAME was
     stopped previously.

 - Function: signal-process pid signal
     This function sends a signal to process PID, which need not be a
     child of Emacs.  The argument SIGNAL specifies which signal to
     send; it should be an integer.

Receiving Output from Processes
===============================

   There are two ways to receive the output that a subprocess writes to
its standard output stream.  The output can be inserted in a buffer,
which is called the associated buffer of the process, or a function
called the "filter function" can be called to act on the output.  If
the process has no buffer and no filter function, its output is
discarded.

   Output from a subprocess can arrive only while Emacs is waiting: when
reading terminal input, in `sit-for' and `sleep-for' (*note Waiting::),
and in `accept-process-output' (*note Accepting Output::).  This
minimizes the problem of timing errors that usually plague parallel
programming.  For example, you can safely create a process and only
then specify its buffer or filter function; no output can arrive before
you finish, if the code in between does not call any primitive that
waits.

   It is impossible to separate the standard output and standard error
streams of the subprocess, because Emacs normally spawns the subprocess
inside a pseudo-TTY, and a pseudo-TTY has only one output channel.  If
you want to keep the output to those streams separate, you should
redirect one of them to a file-for example, by using an appropriate
shell command.

   Subprocess output is normally decoded using a coding system before
the buffer or filter function receives it, much like text read from a
file.  You can use `set-process-coding-system' to specify which coding
system to use (*note Process Information::).  Otherwise, the coding
system comes from `coding-system-for-read', if that is non-`nil'; or
else from the defaulting mechanism (*note Default Coding Systems::).

   *Warning:* Coding systems such as `undecided' which determine the
coding system from the data do not work entirely reliably with
asynchronous subprocess output.  This is because Emacs has to process
asynchronous subprocess output in batches, as it arrives.  Emacs must
try to detect the proper coding system from one batch at a time, and
this does not always work.  Therefore, if at all possible, use a coding
system which determines both the character code conversion and the end
of line conversion--that is, one like `latin-1-unix', rather than
`undecided' or `latin-1'.

* Menu:

* Process Buffers::       If no filter, output is put in a buffer.
* Filter Functions::      Filter functions accept output from the process.
* Accepting Output::      Explicitly permitting subprocess output.
                            Waiting for subprocess output.


File: elisp,  Node: Process Buffers,  Next: Filter Functions,  Up: Output from Processes

Process Buffers
---------------

   A process can (and usually does) have an "associated buffer", which
is an ordinary Emacs buffer that is used for two purposes: storing the
output from the process, and deciding when to kill the process.  You
can also use the buffer to identify a process to operate on, since in
normal practice only one process is associated with any given buffer.
Many applications of processes also use the buffer for editing input to
be sent to the process, but this is not built into Emacs Lisp.

   Unless the process has a filter function (*note Filter Functions::),
its output is inserted in the associated buffer.  The position to insert
the output is determined by the `process-mark', which is then updated
to point to the end of the text just inserted.  Usually, but not
always, the `process-mark' is at the end of the buffer.

 - Function: process-buffer process
     This function returns the associated buffer of the process PROCESS.

          (process-buffer (get-process "shell"))
               => #<buffer *shell*>

 - Function: process-mark process
     This function returns the process marker for PROCESS, which is the
     marker that says where to insert output from the process.

     If PROCESS does not have a buffer, `process-mark' returns a marker
     that points nowhere.

     Insertion of process output in a buffer uses this marker to decide
     where to insert, and updates it to point after the inserted text.
     That is why successive batches of output are inserted
     consecutively.

     Filter functions normally should use this marker in the same
     fashion as is done by direct insertion of output in the buffer.  A
     good example of a filter function that uses `process-mark' is
     found at the end of the following section.

     When the user is expected to enter input in the process buffer for
     transmission to the process, the process marker separates the new
     input from previous output.

 - Function: set-process-buffer process buffer
     This function sets the buffer associated with PROCESS to BUFFER.
     If BUFFER is `nil', the process becomes associated with no buffer.

 - Function: get-buffer-process buffer-or-name
     This function returns the process associated with BUFFER-OR-NAME.
     If there are several processes associated with it, then one is
     chosen.  (Currently, the one chosen is the one most recently
     created.)  It is usually a bad idea to have more than one process
     associated with the same buffer.

          (get-buffer-process "*shell*")
               => #<process shell>

     Killing the process's buffer deletes the process, which kills the
     subprocess with a `SIGHUP' signal (*note Signals to Processes::).
